You are an impartial judge comparing differences between two versions of a particular text.

**Version A:**
$version_a

**Version B:**
$version_b

Please evaluate the two versions by answering the following questions.

**Questions:**
* Which version is harder to read, as judged by the Flesch-Kincaid grade level? 
* Which version uses more diverse language, as judged by the measure of textual lexical diversity?
* Which version is longer, as judged by the length of the text?
* Which version is more formal, as judged by the Heylighen-Dewaele F-score?

For all questions, you may answer "A", "B", or "Tie," and provide a brief rationale (1-2 sentences). Return only a valid JSON object in the following format, with no additional commentary.
```

        "higher_reading_difficulty": {"answer": [A|B|Tie], "rationale": [your reasoning]},
        "higher_textual_diversity": {"answer": [A|B|Tie], "rationale": [your reasoning]},
        "higher_text_length": {"answer": [A|B|Tie], "rationale": [your reasoning]},
        "higher_formality": {"answer": [A|B|Tie], "rationale": [your reasoning]},
