You are an impartial judge grading two versions of a particular text. Your task is to determine which version better-followed the given instruction. Note that the writer may be asked to adjust either reading difficulty or formality, and is expected to keep those the same in the absence of further instructions. 

**Instruction**
$inst

**Version A:**
$version_a

**Version B:**
$version_b

Please evaluate the two versions by answering the following questions.

**Questions:**
* Which version's reading difficulty is closer to what the instruction required, as judged by the Flesch-Kincaid grade level? 
* Which version's formality level is closer to what the instruction required, as judged by the Heylighen-Dewaele F-score?

For all questions, you may answer "A", "B", or "Tie," and provide a brief rationale (1-2 sentences). Return only a valid JSON object in the following format, with no additional commentary.
```
    {
        "higher_reading_difficulty": {"answer": [A|B|Tie], "rationale": [your reasoning]},
        "higher_formality": {"answer": [A|B|Tie], "rationale": [your reasoning]},
    }
```
