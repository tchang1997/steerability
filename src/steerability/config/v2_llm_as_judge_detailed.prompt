You are an impartial judge comparing two versions of a particular text.

**Version A:**
$version_a

**Version B:**
$version_b

Please evaluate the two versions by answering the following questions.

**Questions:**
* Reading difficulty: Which version is harder to read, as judged by the complexity of the words and sentences? 
* Politeness: Which version is more polite, as judged by the usage of hedging, indirectness/directness, or softening strategies? 
* Textual diversity: Which version uses more diverse language, as judged its usage of a broader range of vocabulary and avoidance of repetition in the words and phrases?
* Text length: Which version is more verbose, as judged by the length of the text? 
* Positive emotions: Which version is more positive, as judged by the frequency of words suggesting positive sentiment? 
* Formality: Which version is closer in style to formal writing, such as academic or legal texts, based on its grammar and vocabulary?

For all questions, you may answer "A", "B", or "Tie," and provide a brief rationale (1-2 sentences). Return only a valid JSON object in the following format, with no additional commentary.
