       "FLAVIUS. [Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Their response is hardly surprising. TIMON. See to it, sir, that you convey my message to the senators, those esteemed individuals to whom I have consistently demonstrated my unwavering dedication to the well-being of the state. Request that they dispatch to me, forthwith, a sum of one thousand talents. FLAVIUS. I have taken the liberty of utilizing your seal and name in my approach, as I believed it to be the most expedient method of securing their attention. However, their response has been less than satisfactory, and I have returned to you with no greater wealth. TIMON. Is this truly the case? It defies comprehension. FLAVIUS. They have collectively expressed their regret, citing their current financial difficulties and inability to fulfill their obligations. They acknowledge your honorability, yet their words are laced with insincerity, and they seem uncertain as to how to rectify the situation. They allude to the notion that a noble individual such as yourself may occasionally be subject to misfortune, and that it is a pity that such circumstances have arisen. With this, they have dismissed me, their expressions a mixture of disdain and indifference. TIMON. The gods shall reward them for their ingratitude. I implore you, man, maintain a cheerful demeanor. These elderly individuals have ingrained within them a propensity for ingratitude, a trait that has been passed down through their lineage. Their blood is stagnant, and it rarely flows with kindness; they are devoid of warmth and compassion, and their nature is shaped by a dull and heavy disposition. Proceed to Ventidius. Do not be disheartened, for you are a truthful and honest individual, and I speak these words with sincerity. Ventidius has recently inherited a substantial estate following the passing of his father. In the past, when he was impoverished and imprisoned, I provided him with a sum of five talents. Greet him from me, and request that he consider a pressing necessity that requires his assistance, one that necessitates the repayment of those five talents. If he is in a position to do so, I suggest that he utilize this sum to settle the debt that is owed to me by those individuals who have thus far refused to comply. Never entertain the notion that my fortunes are inextricably linked to those of my friends. FLAVIUS. I wish that I could not harbor such thoughts, for this notion is anathema to the concept of bounty. As a free individual, it assumes that all others are similarly bound, and that their fortunes are inextricably linked to one another. Exeunt.\n",

       "The families of two Australian drug smugglers  today made the torturous journey to Indonesia's notorious 'Death Island' to say their final goodbyes before the pair are executed by firing squad. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were convicted of being ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the  island's airport for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia. They have been on death row since 2005 and have now been transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed this week. Chan's mother Helen and brother Michael were today pictured at Yogyakarta airport as they made their way to the island via boat from Cilacap in central Java. They were accompanied by Sukumaran's mother Raji and sister Brintha, although it is not known whether they will be allowed to see the men as hoped tomorrow when visits are usually banned. Scroll down for videos . The family of condemned Australian drug smuggler Andrew Chan, his mother Helen (centre) and brother Michael (wearing pink shorts) arrive at Yogyakarta airport on Thursday to make the five-hour drive to Cilacap in central Java and take a boat to Nusakambangan island where Chan is waiting to be executed . Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja tried to visit Chan and Sukuraman on the island of Nusakambangan . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia that prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan today. Earlier, a 'chilling' picture emerged of an Indonesian police chief posing with a smile on his face next to Chan on the flight to the island. In the photograph, Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, grins as he stands with his hand on the shoulder of the convicted drug smuggler. In another picture, Hariutomo is seen with his hand on the shoulder of another condemned Australian, Myuran Sukumaran, on the same flight who gazed up at him as the camera flashed. Amnesty’s UK Director Kate Allen described the images as disturbing. She told MailOnline: 'The pictures of guards smiling while escorting their prisoners to Indonesia’s so-called \"Execution Island\" are chilling.' A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand on the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan on a plane taking him to 'Death Island' Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight . The planned executions of Sukumaran, 33, and Chan, 31, have caused diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Australia to fray. The pair are among a group of up to 11 convicts, mostly foreigners, due to be executed on the prison island of Nusakambangan. Chan and Sukumaran were convicted in 2005 as the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the holiday island's main airport for trying to smuggle 8kg (18lb) of heroin to Australia. The seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia. On Thursday, Indonesia rejected an Australian proposal for a prisoner swap made in an 11th hour effort to save the lives of Sukumaran and Chan. Indonesia's foreign ministry said there was no legal basis for Indonesia to act on the proposal that had been made by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . 'Basically Indonesia does not have any regulation or legal framework regarding a prisoner swap,' said Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir. 'This idea was put forward to our minister two days ago and we told them then.' Australian politicians held a candlelight dawn vigil outside parliament house in support of the men early on Thursday, when Bishop said she had spoken to Indonesia's foreign minister earlier this week. 'I raised the fact that there were Indonesian prisoners in Australian jails and whether there was an opportunity for us to consider a prisoner swap, a prisoner transfer or a clemency plea in exchange for a return of prisoners,' Bishop said. 'I just asked for a pause in their preparations for the execution of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan so that we could have officials explore these ideas,' she told Sky News Australia. Australia does not have the death penalty and a recent survey by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute think tank showed nearly two-thirds of the public disapproved of the executions. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had asked to speak again with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday. This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18 . It is not known how the prisoners will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java . In an interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo said the men would be executed soon, but not this week. 'I am still convinced that the justice system in Indonesia, if you look at drug crime, is valid and based on facts and evidence,' he said. 'That's why when I rejected their clemency, I looked at their cases, how many drugs they were carrying.' Indonesia is expected to decide on the date for the executions in a few days, said Tony Spontana, spokesman for the attorney general's office. Widodo has adopted a tough stance against drug traffickers and others on death row, denying clemency appeals. Executions resumed in 2013 after a five-year gap and nationals from Brazil, Malawi, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Vietnam have been among those put in front of a firing squad. Meanwhile, an old school friend has revealed Andrew Chan never thought his impending execution would actually happen. The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp. This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java . 'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said. 'So I always said, 'yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands'.' At least once during their exchange, Chan texted him 'all good bro'. Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.' The spot where the executions are due to take place is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. A school friend of Chan's (left), who went to Homebush Boys High with him (Chan pictured right as a student), told 9News the Australian had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution . Sami and Chan had been exchanging text messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night . At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south. The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner. Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali . This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad . In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner. When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution. A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place. Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Version B:**\n",
       "Mats Hummels is in the frame to leave for Manchester United, Ilkay Gundogan has yet to sign a contract extension and can leave in 2016 and even the much-vaunted re-signing of Marco Reus might have simply been a stalling tactic to wait for a move to Barcelona next summer. On top of all that, Borussia Dortmund, the club which charmed the world two years ago on their rampaging run to the Champions League final, have battled relegation all season and were comprehensively beaten by Juventus in the Champions League last week. You might be forgiven for thinking that here was a club on the slide. But what about the notion of Dortmund in Europe next season? It would seem a non-starter. Borussia Dortmund are starting to look up again following a nightmare start to the season . Part of Dortmund's remarkable 10,000-strong support in Hannover for their Bundesliga match last weekend . Defender Mats Hummels has been strongly linked with a summer move to Manchester United . For most of the world, their last sight of Dortmund's plight in the Bundesliga were those infamous photos of captain Hummels and goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller climbing the surround fencing to reason with angry fans from the 'Yellow Wall' after the home defeat by Augsburg last month left the team bottom. Yet the 3-2 win at Hannover at the weekend was a sixth victory in a run of eight games undefeated and sparked some crazy talk. 'Now we need to focus our eyes in the direction of the Europa League,' said double goalscorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Club chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke was a little more cautious. 'It's more important to put some distance between us and the relegation battle first,' he said. While manager Jurgen Klopp and Hummels struck some sensible middle ground. 'We're no longer in the middle of a relegation battle,' said Klopp. 'Let's get to the point whereby we mathematically can't be relegated and then let's see how many games we have.' Hummels, looking ahead to what would normally be a title-deciding clash with Bayern, said: 'We want to beat Bayern. At the moment we're in no-man's land but we could still slip back. If we beat Bayern, then we'll see.' Star man Marco Reus has signed a contract extension but could still move to Barcelona in 2016 . Ilkay Gundogan (right) has yet to commit to a new Dortmund contract and could leave in the summer . After an upturn in form, Dortmund find themselves just five points off a Europa League place . Manager Jurgen Klopp (second right) with Sebastian Kehl and Jakub Blaszczykowski after Saturday's win . Whether Europe is realistic or not - they are five points off the Europa League places with eight games to play - Dortmund are in a much better place than a couple of months ago. No-one truly believed they could go down, yet at times they seemed intent on testing the proposition to the full. But Reus signing a new four-year contract was an enormous boost, all the more so as it contained no release clause. It may well be that Reus joins Barcelona in the summer of 2016, the Catalan club where his friend Marc-Andre ter Stegen already plays understood to be his preferred destination. Even so, Reus should be at the Westfalenstadion next season. Hummels may not be. Louis van Gaal attempted to bring him back to Bayern Munich when coach there; he will undoubtedly try to do the same again this summer, though he will have to meet the £35m asking price. Interestingly, sources at Dortmund are already putting it about that £35m would make up for the shortfall of missing out in the Champions League, which sounds like a pre-sale process of softening up the fans. The lowest point in Dortmund's season came when players like Hummels had to front up to the fans . But an upturn in fortunes has lifted them out of relegation danger - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (left) and Marco Reus here wear masks to celebrate a goal in the 3-0 defeat of rivals Schalke . The Dortmund player salute their travelling support after last weekend's 3-2 win at Hannover . The key question remains about the man who has come to personify Dortmund, Klopp. Like Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, Klopp's personality, tactics and energy seem to embody every area of the club. Understandably Klopp is always considered when top jobs come up. He was on the shortlist to replace Roberto Mancini at Manchester City but did not impress in interview - the passion that drives his teams sits uncomfortably with the increasingly corporate world of football executives. It looks as though those pushing for him as a natural replacement for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal overplayed their hand somewhat. The intensity of the rivalry with Bayern Munich means he is highly unlikely to end up there when Pep Guardiola ends his time in 2016. Striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang poses for a photo with Dortmund fans after Saturday's win . Former Manchester United man Shinji Kagawa celebrates with Reus after scoring at Hannover . And there is a feeling that many teams are now adept at dealing with the frenzied counter-attacking style and that he needs to add nuance to the tactics that so recently shocked Europe's best sides. For now it looks as if Klopp and Dortmund's fates are bound together. At times, the rollercoaster season has seemed a projection on the ups and downs of Klopp's own volatile personality. Yet it's not so long ago he was a genuine wunderkind of European football. If he can emerge refreshed and re-energised from this season's chaos, there seems no reason why Dortmund shouldn't rise again in Europe. The next few weeks should tell us much. If Dortmund do make the Europa League, then you might conclude that the rebuilding process is already underway.\n",

       "You've probably heard about the alarming rise in cases of meningitis W in the UK. It's a potentially deadly disease that's been spreading rapidly, and experts are sounding the alarm. Just to put things into perspective, back in 2009, there were only 22 reported cases of meningitis W. But fast forward to last year, and that number skyrocketed to a whopping 117 cases, according to Public Health England. That's a staggering 431% increase, and some experts are even calling it a public health emergency.\n",
       "\n",
       "At first, the rise in cases was mainly seen in adults, but now it's affecting all age groups, including young children. Yes, you read that right - for the first time in a decade, young kids have lost their lives to this disease. And if that's not enough, there's also been a significant increase in cases among students. It's like a ticking time bomb, and something needs to be done ASAP.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, what's the plan to stop this disease in its tracks? Well, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has proposed a major immunization program to protect teenagers aged 14 to 18. The idea is to give them a vaccine that will help prevent the spread of meningitis W. Andrew Pollard, the chairman of the JCVI, said that the current strain of the disease is \"highly aggressive\" and that unless action is taken, the number of cases will continue to rise.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pollard and his team have been reviewing the outbreak in detail, and they're convinced that a vaccination program for teenagers will have a significant impact on the disease. They're urging the Department of Health to implement the program as soon as possible, and it's great to see that the government is finally taking action.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, some campaigners are pointing out that the government's delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B, the last major strain of the disease, may have hindered the fight against meningitis W. It's a bit like trying to put out a fire when you're still dealing with the embers from the previous one. One baby dies every month in the UK from meningitis B, and charities claim that dozens of lives have been lost unnecessarily because of the government's procrastination.\n",
       "\n",
       "Chris Head, from the Meningitis Research Foundation, is applauding the government's quick action to protect teenagers with the MenACWY vaccine. However, he's also warning that it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime, under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of meningitis W. It's a bit of a Catch-22 situation, and it highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to tackling this disease.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, what can we do to help? Well, for starters, we can support the government's efforts to introduce a vaccination program for teenagers. We can also raise awareness about the risks of meningitis W and the importance of getting vaccinated. And, of course, we can continue to push for more research and funding to tackle this disease head-on.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's time to take action and protect our communities from this deadly disease. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and our loved ones to do everything we can to prevent meningitis W from spreading further. Let's work together to make a difference and create a safer, healthier future for everyone.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Version B:**\n",
       "There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England (file image) A major immunisation programme aims to protect teenagers against a potentially lethal new strain of meningitis after a steep rise in cases. There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England. This is a rise of 431 per cent. Some experts said the levels could even indicate a public health emergency. While the rise was initially seen in adults, it has now extended to all age groups and, for the first time in a decade, young children have died as a result of MenW. There has also been a rise in cases among students. It is proposed to immunise teenagers aged 14 to 18 in an attempt to halt the disease’s spread. Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the upsurge in cases was caused by a ‘highly aggressive strain of the bug’. He said: ‘We reviewed the outbreak in detail and concluded that this increase was likely to continue in future years unless action is taken. ‘We have therefore advised the Department of Health to implement a vaccination programme for teenagers as soon as possible which we believe will have a substantial impact on the disease and protect the public’s health.’ Campaigners said the Government’s delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B – the last major strain of the disease – may have hindered the fight. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from meningitis B and charities claim dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials. Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We applaud the quick action by the Government to protect 14 to 18-year-olds using the MenACWY vaccine. ‘However, it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of MenW.’\n",

       "Manchester City and Montenegro forward Stevan Jovetic claims Russia were waiting for an excuse before their Euro 2016 qualifier was abandoned amid chaotic scenes on Friday. The Group G game in Podgorica was marred by trouble from the first minute when play was suspended for over half an hour after Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was struck by a flare thrown from the stands. German referee Deniz Aytekin eventually abandoned the match after a missed second-half penalty by Russia's Roman Shirokov led to a mass brawl on the pitch while riot police struggled to contain supporters off it.

Jovetic hopes the violent scenes will not see Montenegro punished too harshly, while suggesting the Russians were searching for an excuse to lodge a complaint. 'I have problems finding words after this incident,' he told reporters. 'I just hope the fine won't be too harsh. 'However, it seems like the Russians waited for the smallest thing to happen so they can tell the referee.' Meanwhile, Montenegrin fans who keep causing trouble and forced Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Russia to be abandoned are 'barbarians', according to the general secretary of their FA. 'These fans sing \"Montenegro we love you\" but throw flares, insult rivals and cause all sorts of incidents every time they turn up and that's outright hypocrisy,' general secretary Momir Djurdjevac told reporters after the ugly scenes in the stadium.

We can only thank God that no one was seriously hurt.' Montenegro face Denmark next on June 8 and currently sit, level with Russia, with five points from four games.\n",

       "Upon reflection, I realized that my visit to the coast had been unproductive. Having been the bearer of Ada's letter and intended to accompany Richard back to London, I had accomplished nothing by coming down. I decided to return to the hotel and wait for Richard to join me, and as I departed, I noticed a commotion near the beach. A group of naval officers had arrived from a boat, and people were gathered around them, showing great interest. I surmised that the boat belonged to one of the great Indiaman ships, and we stopped to observe. The officers, who seemed pleased to be back in England, were greeted warmly by the crowd. I quickly excused myself, feeling a sudden urge to leave, and it wasn't until we were alone in our cabin that I realized why I had been in such a hurry. I had seen Mr. Allan Woodcourt among the officers, and I was afraid he might recognize me. I had been taken aback, and my courage had failed me. However, I knew I couldn't let my fears get the better of me. I reminded myself that there was no reason to be ashamed, and I called upon my resolve to stand firm. After a moment, I regained my composure and was relieved to find that I was in control once more. The officers eventually arrived at the hotel, and I recognized Mr. Woodcourt's voice on the staircase. I was torn between the desire to avoid him and my determination to make contact. I decided to send him a message, and when he came to see me, I greeted him warmly, welcoming him back to England. I could see that he was genuinely sorry for me, and I told him about my illness, which I had learned about through Miss Flite, one of his patients.\n",

       "A Chinese man who has been left with a memory that lasts just five minutes has found the only way he can cope is to continually write down every detail of his life in a precious notebook. Chen Hongzhi, 25, from Hsinchu county, Beipu, suffered a serious head injury in a car accident when he was a teenager which has left him with virtually no memory, The People's Daily reports. He writes down everything - from the people he meets in the street to the weather - as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. Memory book: Chen Hongzhi uses the notebook to write down people he meets and what he does each day after being left with a five-minute memory following a car crash . Chen suffered the severe brain injury in a car accident when he was 17 and spent months in intensive care in hospital. While his body recovered, his memory loss is still so severe that he often forgets things that happened between five and 10 minutes ago. The debilitating condition also means that Chen cannot remember how to write properly, so he makes notes in a phonetic 'scrawl' that mostly only he understands. 'This is my record, I write in it everyday, even if it is pouring down with rain or if I don't go out to do the weeding I still l must write, \"Heavy rain\",' he said. 'Whenever I get home from any time away  I quickly grab my notebook and write down important things from the day - who I've met, what I've done, how much money I got from recycling bottles, all that sort of stuff.' Life record: Chen writes down everything from the people he meets in the street to the weather as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. He has even developed his own language . Dependants: Chen Hongzhi with his mother Wang Miao-chiong, who starts the day by handing Chen his notebook and reminding him he is no-longer 17. They are reliant on each other following the recent death of his father . Every day when Chen wakes up, his mother, Wang Miao-chiong, must remind him that he is no longer 17 and eight years have passed. She hands him the notebook so he can read what has happened in his life since the accident and check important details like who his friends are and what needs to be done that day. Chen's story has spread online in China after it was compared to that of the fictional character played by Nicole Kidman in the film Before I Go to Sleep. His condition means Chen is unable to hold down a job so he raises a small amount of money by walking several kilometres collecting plastic bottles. Chen also collects wood that he and his mother use to make a fire to cook their food. His mother, 60, said the practical system has kept Chen going for years, but she worries about what will happen to him after she has gone, particularly given the recent death of his father. Guide to life: Chen Hongzhi, 25, has had to write everything down after he suffered brain injuries that left him with a five-minute memory, when he was 17 . They get by on donations from neighbours and friends in the tiny village in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County, who have given Chen the nickname 'short memory man' because he forgets having met them within 24 hours. She said the family had initially hoped he would go back to school but soon realised there would be little point. 'It had been planned that would go back to school but there was no point as he could never remember the lessons, and has been living at home with me ever since.' Before the accident: Chen poses with a pony before a car accident left him with very little memory . Hard worker: Despite having very little memory, Chen collects firewood for his family to use in the stove . The pair are totally dependent on each other, with Chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he, in turn, provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores. A severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss. Memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it. Damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss. Head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident. A person can appear to be relatively well, but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted. They can also forget the time from before the brain injury – called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia – and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months. But the most common – and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss. This can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Examples of this are forgetting what has just been said, having difficulty in learning a new skill, repeating the same question over and over, forgetting people's names, getting details mixed up, forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed. There is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem, and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies. However, memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it. Source: Headway: The Brain Injury Association . After the death of his father, he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities, where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story, and posted on social media where it quickly spread. Beipu village chief, Liu Chin-ting, said the family receives monthly support from Hsinchu County's social welfare department, which is helping the family to get by. Welfare workers also make it a point to visit Chen and his mother during festive holidays, he said. But Liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training. He said: 'He needs to get some preparation because his mother won't be there forever, and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job'. The family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but Chief Liu, who is helping to negotiate, said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper, rice, salt and soy sauce. He said: 'Once the basics are sorted out, perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term, but at the moment they just need to survive.' Chen meanwhile is clearly happy, as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he's very happy that people want to help. He knows he is destined to forget everything, but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour. He said: 'I am reading here about all the people that want to give me money, but I would say don't give me too much, because it looks as if I'll probably forget where I put it all.' In the film Before I Go to Sleep, 40-year-old Christine Lucas, played by Nicole Kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before. In a remarkable similarity, she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident. Alike: Chen's story has led to comparisons between himself and Holywood blockbuster Before I Go to Sleep (2014), starring Nicole Kidman as Christine Lucas and Colin Firth as Ben Lucas .\n",

Take a couple of a key casting choices announced this week. \"Shark Tank\" star and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban will play the President of the United States in \"Sharknado 3.\" Care to venture a guess on his Veep?  Try political commentator Ann Coulter. It\\'s a match made in Twitter heaven. \"Will Ann Coulter Be Eaten Alive In Sharknado 3?\" a hopeful sounding Political Pirate tweets. Yes, there actually is one, or as much as there\\'s ever been one. This time around a sharknado will tear into in the nation\\'s capital, before roaring down the Eastern Seaboard and into Florida. Anyone taking bets on how long Cuban and Coulter will last? The first two \"Sharknado\" films churned up a storm of laughs and flooded the Twitterverse with clever one liners. #Sharknado2TheSecondOne was the top-trending hashtag on Twitter the night it first aired. \"No sharks were harmed or actors paid in the filming of Sharknado 2,\" said Annie B. \"#Sharknado2 was filmed in just 18 days,\" tweeted comedian Jeff Dwoskin.  \"Credit to everyone, it totally looks like a 24 day shoot.\" There are a raft full of D-list celebrities in this one. Back are regulars Ian Ziering as Finley \"Fin\" Shepherd, and Tara Reid as April Wexler. And a few other tasty offerings. Bo Derek plays the mother of Reid\\'s character, April. NSYNC\\'s Chris Kirkpatrick plays a pool lifeguard. And Jerry Springer appears as Mr. White, a manic tourist. \"Great fun being in #Sharknado3,\" the talk show host says.  \"But -- spoiler alert — it doesn\\'t end well for me.\" With this cast, things should go swimmingly.',\n",

He was very strong\\nand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood\\naway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green\\nlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell\\ntoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry\\nout joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade\\nof moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He\\nshowed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade\\nand stirred the earth and let the air in. They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses\\nwhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation\\nof surprise. \"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \"Who did that\\nthere?\" It was one of Mary\\'s own little clearings round the pale green points. \"I did it,\" said Mary. \"Why, I thought tha\\' didn\\'t know nothin\\' about gardenin\\',\" he exclaimed. \"I don\\'t,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and the grass was so\\nthick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So I made a place for them. I don\\'t even know what they are.\" Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile. \"Tha\\' was right,\" he said. \"A gardener couldn\\'t have told thee better.

I\\'ve chased about th\\' moor in all\\nweathers same as th\\' rabbits does. Mother says I\\'ve sniffed up too\\nmuch fresh air for twelve year\\' to ever get to sniffin\\' with cold.

I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell\\nme.

He almost\\nhates me.\" \"He hates the garden, because she died,\" said Mary half speaking to\\nherself. \"What garden?\" the boy asked. \"Oh! just--just a garden she used to like,\" Mary stammered. \"Have you\\nbeen here always?\" \"Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to\\nplaces at the seaside, but I won\\'t stay because people stare at me. I\\nused to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor\\ncame from London to see me and said it was stupid. He told them to\\ntake it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I\\ndon\\'t want to go out.\" \"I didn\\'t when first I came here,\" said Mary. \"Why do you keep looking\\nat me like that?\" \"Because of the dreams that are so real,\" he answered rather fretfully.',\n",
       "       'And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff,\\nand there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and\\nsafe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased\\nhim so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at\\nfirst Mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself, with his\\nbig eyes and heavy locks of hair. \"I did not know birds could be like that,\" he said. \"But if you stay\\nin a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel\\nas if you had been inside that garden.\" She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He\\nevidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a\\nsurprise. \"I am going to let you look at something,\" he said. \"Do you see that\\nrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?\" Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a\\ncurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"There is a cord hanging from it,\" said Colin. \"Go and pull it.\" Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it\\nthe silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a\\npicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had\\nbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were\\nexactly like Colin\\'s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big\\nas they really were because of the black lashes all round them. \"She is my mother,\" said Colin complainingly. \"I don\\'t see why she\\ndied. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.\" \"How queer!\" said Mary. \"If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,\" he\\ngrumbled. \"I dare say I should have lived, too.

       "       'There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and\\nended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she\\nwould slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were\\nany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when\\nshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she\\nheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it\\nwas. It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she\\nstopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back\\nagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy\\nabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such\\nround and such blue eyes in any boy\\'s face. And on the trunk of the\\ntree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him,\\nand from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up\\nand sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they\\nwere all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little\\ncall his pipe seemed to make. When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost\\nas low as and rather like his piping. \"Don\\'t tha\\' move,\" he said. \"It\\'d flight \\'em.\" Mary remained\\nmotionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the\\nground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were\\nmoving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel\\nscampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew\\nhis head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away,\\nthough not at all as if they were frightened. \"I\\'m Dickon,\" the boy said. \"I know tha\\'rt Miss Mary.\" Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was\\nDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the\\nnatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and\\nhis smile spread all over his face. \"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha\\' makes a quick move it\\nstartles \\'em. A body \\'as to move gentle an\\' speak low when wild things\\nis about.\" He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but\\nas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she\\nspoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy. \"Did you get Martha\\'s letter?\" she asked. He nodded his curly, rust-colored head. \"That\\'s why I come.\" He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground\\nbeside him when he piped. \"I\\'ve got th\\' garden tools.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read\\nand write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to\\nsix times seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get\\nany further than that if I was to live forever. I don\\'t take no stock\\nin mathematics, anyway. At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got\\nnext day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to\\nschool the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the\\nwidow\\'s ways, too, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me. Living in a house\\nand sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the\\ncold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and\\nso that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting\\nso I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was\\ncoming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she\\nwarn\\'t ashamed of me. One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I\\nreached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of\\nme, and crossed me off. She says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry;\\nwhat a mess you are always making!\" The widow put in a good word for\\nme, but that warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well\\nenough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to\\nbe. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t\\none of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked\\nalong low-spirited and on the watch-out. I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\\nthrough the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\\nground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks. They had come up from the quarry\\nand stood around the stile awhile, and then went on around the garden\\nfence. It was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so. I\\ncouldn\\'t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to\\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I\\ndidn\\'t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in\\nthe left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my\\nshoulder every now and then, but I didn\\'t see nobody. I was at Judge\\nThatcher\\'s as quick as I could get there. He said:\\n\\n\"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.',\n",

Have we not?\" \"Oh, yes, papa!\" cried the three daughters. \"In fact, that is our family department,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"in this\\nhurly-burly of life.

       "       'well, first of all, let me give you an idea about me. i am usually unlucky in a way that even makes me laugh. and in every airport i have been in, i get the \"random security search\" treatment, not only in the states, but also in europe and middle east. i\\'m ethnically white, however, i have spent fair amount of time under the sun, which puts me in a zone where i get to be hugged by every nation from middle east to south america.\\non this lucky day, i was traveling from my home country to usa where i was getting my undergrad education back in 2010. my flight was through london heathrow airport, where i was familiar with. the airline clerks could not get me checked into the flight from london to usa due to technical errors, so they have asked me to stop by the american airlines to get that fixed in london. \\n\\na couple of hours later, the clerk was checking my passport before checking me in, the usual. she found this extremely small rip in an empty page of my passport. but this wasn\\'t new, it happened 2 years ago. i had traveled like that for a while now. however, i have to give credit to my father that warned me billion times about this. \\nanyway, she told me that she needs to call an officer to ask if i can travel like that. at that point, i knew i was the gta level 2 suspect. a couple of minutes passed, and she told me i was all set. i knew that was a lie. so i grabbed myself a sandwich and fed myself, before i get in any trouble. a full stomach always makes things better. \\nso i went to my gate where i saw a handful of police officers checking the passports of the passengers. i was like, they are looking for me, i can feel it. they saw my passport, and ding ding ding ding!, bingo. \\n \\n - sir, could you step to this side please?\\n\\nthey have explained to me that i was not allowed to fly with a torn passport, so i was suggested to have a conversation with the clerk that caused this. i went back to the ticket place, and told her what happened. i could feel something funny was about to happen. so, she suggested that i should go to the embassy in london to fix this problem, and i thought that could work. \\ni went to the exit of the airport, and handed the piece of paper where i needed to fill in. reminder: i live in a country with a passport that requires a visa to %99 of the world. \\ni told the officer what happened, and she told me that she will get this situation fixed and let me go to london to sort this situation out, only with a visa for 24 hours. after half an hour, i assume a higher duty officer, a commander let\\'s say, came by. he asked me what makes me think i can travel to london without a proper passport when i could not travel to usa?  i told him that this was not my idea. he rolled his british eyes over, and probably said \"i\\'m not buying this paki boy.\" (no offence to pakistani people.) 15 mins later, he says i have got 1 good and 1 bad news. you cannot go to your embassy in london; you are going back to your own country. i said ok. what else i could say. 15 mins later, the commander said that there is no flight back tonight, so you will be our guest tonight. \\n\\ni told myself \"this is fine, i will spend a night at the airport hotel, and go home the next day with a funny story.\" i did go home the next day with a funny story, but i also get to be treated like i am the dark leader of some radical group. \\n\\nthey first took me to a questioning room, not like the one in the movies. it had computers, i was getting pictures taken, questions asked, and giving finger prints. i signed a paper that says \"it is not my fault that i could not travel to my final destination.\" they took my belongings, including my passport, and gave me a pillow, a blanket, a sandwich, and a peeled orange. i was taken to a room with 3 walls and 1 mirror, filled with people who have no passports, no visa, no life etc. you get the picture right? in addition to these, tv was placed in the wall, (so you cannot throw it), the chairs was fixed to the floor. i am getting the full isis treatment. one prepaid phone and one bathroom with no locks. i ate my meal and went to sleep, only to wake up to crying and yelling sounds that my possible inmates were making.\\n\\naround 2 am, an officer woke me up and told me that i will be questioned again. i got up, went to a hollywood-ish room. an officer asked me bunch of similar questions to see if i fail or stutter. something like. - why are you traveling to the usa?\\n+ i am an undergraduate student; i am getting my education there.\\nfew unrelated questions later. - what are you doing in the usa?\\n+ i am an undergraduate student; i am getting my education there.\\n\\ni passed the test, and went back to the chair i was sleeping. around 5 am, another officer woke me up. apparently, i was getting full body check-up for some reason. i was like, allright.\\naround 8.30 am, they woke me up. two police officers had my luggage, and one officer had my passport in a file. i was getting through securities without waiting and check-ups. i was 21, i was feeling like a million bucks due to the fact that people were looking at me like \"who is this mofo\". (excuse my french) i was laughing hard inside too.\\n\\ntwo police officers put my luggage to my flight and left. two undercover officers and the officer that was holding my passport traveled to my home country with me, only to make sure i don\\'t turn this flight around i guess. lol. they handed me to the officers at the airport. i got my passport fixed, and went back to the usa the next day.',\n",

(for those of you asking where the fuck i mow grass during winter? i live in the sunshine state. anyways i start my mowing like any other time and i get the front yard done in record time, 30 minutes at the most. i then go back in the garage to re fuel before i do the back yard. here's where the crazy shit begins, mrs.akers peeks out the door leading from the garage to inside the house asks me 'do you want that drink now?' it was pretty hot so i said sure why not. normally she brings me the drink but this time was different... she asks me to come in and cool down a bit and i jumped on that chance because again, it was hot. i enter the house (this was my first time in their house) and it felt great! the a.c was cranking. i asked her where her kids were and come to find out that they go to a private school so they still had school on mlk day. anyways she leads me to the kitchen and asks me to take a seat so i did, and she proceeded to give me a bottle of vitamin water. i thanked her for it and started walking out to the garage and then i hear 'hey you wanna just relax for a bit? i don't want you to overwork yourself' i mean i didn't have anything else to do the rest of the day so i happily accepted. we sat down in the living room and just talked about random things like school, work, and then she asks me if i had a girlfriend. i used some lame excuse and said that i didn't really have time for one, her response was 'yeah, apparently neither does my husband' i chuckled and told her that i noticed he's always out. this sparked a conversation that i wasn't ready for.. she practically started telling me her love life, i sat there and just nodded and seemed interested. she then started acting all weird saying 'i'd give anything to go back to my young days, i was so hot back in my late teens' i tried my best to not sound weird and i told her that she's still a beautiful lady (she really is kinda hot) and that i'm sure her husband thinks the same. she looks at me with this weird gaze and says 'you really think so? your so sweet!' i just smiled and said thanks. she then started telling me that i'm 'such a good looking young guy' and when i do have time for a girlfriend, the girl i chose is going to be one lucky girl. i said thanks and gave her a joking wink. now i don't know if she took that serious or what because she then put her hand on my shoulder and squeezed a bit followed by 'honestly i watch you every time you come to mow... you give me something to look at when i'm bored in this house' i didn't know how to respond so i jokingly said 'is that a good thing?' she responds with 'very'. i was shocked actually, i felt like i was in one of those pornos. not even kidding. she then told me i had to get back to work so i obliged and stood up. little did i know that she was baiting a hook. when i stood up she did as well and told me she wanted to hug me for sitting and talking to her, i didn't think much of it and said sure. when she came in for the hug i saw her left arm reach around me like she was giving me a hug and then she fucking grabbed my junk!  i didn't know what to do! i was so shocked i just stood there (it was actually awesome, by this point i totally knew she wanted me) i took my chance and made a quirky comment, 'whoa mrs.akers, you could of at least asked first' this was like a fucking remote trigger to a nuke planted in isis headquarters! she then asks me if she could do it again.. i didn't care, honestly i wanted her too. she then grabs at it again and leans in for a kiss. by this point i was totally letting loose. we start kissing and i can feel her rubbing my waist and slowly work her way in my pants. before i knew it i had a 30ish year old woman playing the skin flute like a motherfucking professional! one thing leads to another and we are on the living room sofa, undressed having a crazy fucking time. (i don't want to go into detail since this isn't a porn thread). about 45 minutes later it's all done with. i was in pure shock... i couldn't believe i just had sex with my neighbor. in a way i felt bad but holy shit was that fun. we laid there for about 20 minutes afterwards and cuddled up a bit. she then said that i should probably get going since her husband was due to arrive within the hour. so i stood up, got dressed then it hit me that i never mowed the back yard. i reminded her and she responded with 'well it's no big deal, come finish it tomorrow', and winked at me. i just nodded and told her i will definitely come finish it tomorrow. i walked out through the garage and went home thinking about this craziness that just went down. i sat at home and thought i had to tell reddit. i couldn't go without sharing this with you guys. i've been up all night debating whether it was a good idea or not and finally gave in. \\n\\nhere's the thing though... i for sure have to go back tomorrow to finish the lawn. what if she comes on to me again?!? do i give in?? i feel a bit bad for having sex with some guys wife... then again he isn't doing anything to satisfy her. idk guys what do you think?\\n\\nupdate-jan 20th 1:20 pm: i'm walking over to her house in about 5 minutes i'll update you guys and tell you what comes of this shit storm.\\n\\nupdate-jan 20th 4:30 pm. so i went to her house and things were a bit normal. she answered the door and told me she was expecting me. she opened the garage door and i figured she just wanted to brush it off since nothing was mentioned. i did what i went to do and mowed the back yard as quick as possible since i just wanted to go home. once i was done i put everything back in its place and knocked on the door and told her i was done and ready to receive my payment. she usually pays me 40 bucks and calls it a day.  not today though... today she goes to in her pocket book and pulls out a hundred dollar bill and says i can have it, but i have to come in for a little... thoughts raced my mind... i wasn't sure what to do. but 100 bucks would be awesome! i gave in and walked inside. i for sure thought she was going to start trying to seduce me again. she didn't... actually she said 'okay, you can have this money but only if you promise to never speak of what happened yesterday to anybody' i was so happy! she just let it go. i told her that i agree and that it was just a thing and we got carried away, it won't happen again. we left it at that, as i was walking away she says 'but i'm keeping the video' i felt my heart sink and my face turn pale as i turned around and said 'excuse me?'. she starts laughing and says 'i'm just kidding!' i just laughed hysterically... i really hoped she was kidding. i said 'good one mrs.akers' and exited her house. \\nbut wait there's more! i went home got a shower and got dressed. i left my house, got some food, and went to my friends house (where i am now). i got a call from a random number about 20 minutes ago.. i picked it up and some man answered saying \\nman: 'hey is this (followed by my name)?' \\n\\nme: 'yeah what's up, who is this?. man: 'it's mr.akers, could you possibly come by my house later? i need to talk to you. my fucking hearted literally stopped. this is it! he fucking knows. idk. i'm dealing out! should i go?\\n\\ni told him i was at a friends house, if i'm back in the neighborhood at a decent time i'd stop in.\\n\\ni'm sitting here at my friends house freaking out. i told him the situation and he literally sounded so excited that i had sex with a milf. there's millions of things rushing through my head!! should i actually go?!?\\n\\n\\nupdate!! i wrote a part 2. http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2t4en6/tifu_and_became_a_homewrecker_part_2/\",\n",

       "array(['(CNN)Say what you will about the \"Sharknado\" franchise, but there\\'s no doubt, it\\'s swimming in irony. Take a couple of a key casting choices announced this week. \"Shark Tank\" star and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban will play the President of the United States in \"Sharknado 3.\" Care to venture a guess on his Veep?  Try political commentator Ann Coulter. It\\'s a match made in Twitter heaven. \"Will Ann Coulter Be Eaten Alive In Sharknado 3?\" a hopeful sounding Political Pirate tweets. Yes, there actually is one, or as much as there\\'s ever been one. This time around a sharknado will tear into in the nation\\'s capital, before roaring down the Eastern Seaboard and into Florida. Anyone taking bets on how long Cuban and Coulter will last? The first two \"Sharknado\" films churned up a storm of laughs and flooded the Twitterverse with clever one liners. #Sharknado2TheSecondOne was the top-trending hashtag on Twitter the night it first aired. \"No sharks were harmed or actors paid in the filming of Sharknado 2,\" said Annie B. \"#Sharknado2 was filmed in just 18 days,\" tweeted comedian Jeff Dwoskin.  \"Credit to everyone, it totally looks like a 24 day shoot.\" There are a raft full of D-list celebrities in this one. Back are regulars Ian Ziering as Finley \"Fin\" Shepherd, and Tara Reid as April Wexler. And a few other tasty offerings. Bo Derek plays the mother of Reid\\'s character, April. NSYNC\\'s Chris Kirkpatrick plays a pool lifeguard. And Jerry Springer appears as Mr. White, a manic tourist. \"Great fun being in #Sharknado3,\" the talk show host says.  \"But -- spoiler alert — it doesn\\'t end well for me.\" With this cast, things should go swimmingly.',\n",

       "       'Look at it.\" Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might. \"When it looks a bit greenish an\\' juicy like that, it\\'s wick,\" he\\nexplained. \"When th\\' inside is dry an\\' breaks easy, like this here\\npiece I\\'ve cut off, it\\'s done for.

He was very strong\\nand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood\\naway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green\\nlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell\\ntoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry\\nout joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade\\nof moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He\\nshowed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade\\nand stirred the earth and let the air in. They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses\\nwhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation\\nof surprise. \"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \"Who did that\\nthere?\" It was one of Mary\\'s own little clearings round the pale green points. \"I did it,\" said Mary. \"Why, I thought tha\\' didn\\'t know nothin\\' about gardenin\\',\" he exclaimed. \"I don\\'t,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and the grass was so\\nthick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So I made a place for them. I don\\'t even know what they are.\" Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile. \"Tha\\' was right,\" he said. \"A gardener couldn\\'t have told thee better.

I\\'ve chased about th\\' moor in all\\nweathers same as th\\' rabbits does. Mother says I\\'ve sniffed up too\\nmuch fresh air for twelve year\\' to ever get to sniffin\\' with cold.

I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell\\nme. Oh! do come, Dickon!\" \"I\\'ll come every day if tha\\' wants me, rain or shine,\" he answered\\nstoutly. \"It\\'s the best fun I ever had in my life--shut in here an\\'\\nwakenin\\' up a garden.\" \"If you will come,\" said Mary, \"if you will help me to make it alive\\nI\\'ll--I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do,\" she ended helplessly.

He almost\\nhates me.\" \"He hates the garden, because she died,\" said Mary half speaking to\\nherself. \"What garden?\" the boy asked. \"Oh! just--just a garden she used to like,\" Mary stammered. \"Have you\\nbeen here always?\" \"Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to\\nplaces at the seaside, but I won\\'t stay because people stare at me. I\\nused to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor\\ncame from London to see me and said it was stupid. He told them to\\ntake it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I\\ndon\\'t want to go out.\" \"I didn\\'t when first I came here,\" said Mary. \"Why do you keep looking\\nat me like that?\" \"Because of the dreams that are so real,\" he answered rather fretfully.',\n",
       "       'And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff,\\nand there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and\\nsafe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased\\nhim so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at\\nfirst Mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself, with his\\nbig eyes and heavy locks of hair. \"I did not know birds could be like that,\" he said. \"But if you stay\\nin a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel\\nas if you had been inside that garden.\" She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He\\nevidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a\\nsurprise. \"I am going to let you look at something,\" he said. \"Do you see that\\nrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?\" Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a\\ncurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"There is a cord hanging from it,\" said Colin. \"Go and pull it.\" Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it\\nthe silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a\\npicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had\\nbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were\\nexactly like Colin\\'s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big\\nas they really were because of the black lashes all round them. \"She is my mother,\" said Colin complainingly. \"I don\\'t see why she\\ndied. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.\" \"How queer!\" said Mary. \"If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,\" he\\ngrumbled. \"I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would\\nnot have hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong\\nback. Draw the curtain again.\" Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.',\n",
       "       'There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and\\nended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she\\nwould slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were\\nany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when\\nshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she\\nheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it\\nwas. It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she\\nstopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back\\nagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy\\nabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such\\nround and such blue eyes in any boy\\'s face. And on the trunk of the\\ntree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him,\\nand from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up\\nand sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they\\nwere all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little\\ncall his pipe seemed to make. When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost\\nas low as and rather like his piping. \"Don\\'t tha\\' move,\" he said. \"It\\'d flight \\'em.\" Mary remained\\nmotionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the\\nground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were\\nmoving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel\\nscampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew\\nhis head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away,\\nthough not at all as if they were frightened. \"I\\'m Dickon,\" the boy said. \"I know tha\\'rt Miss Mary.\" Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was\\nDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the\\nnatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and\\nhis smile spread all over his face. \"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha\\' makes a quick move it\\nstartles \\'em. A body \\'as to move gentle an\\' speak low when wild things\\nis about.\" He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but\\nas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she\\nspoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy. \"Did you get Martha\\'s letter?\" she asked. He nodded his curly, rust-colored head. \"That\\'s why I come.\" He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground\\nbeside him when he piped. \"I\\'ve got th\\' garden tools.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read\\nand write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to\\nsix times seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get\\nany further than that if I was to live forever. I don\\'t take no stock\\nin mathematics, anyway. At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got\\nnext day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to\\nschool the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the\\nwidow\\'s ways, too, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me. Living in a house\\nand sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the\\ncold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and\\nso that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting\\nso I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was\\ncoming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she\\nwarn\\'t ashamed of me. One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I\\nreached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of\\nme, and crossed me off. She says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry;\\nwhat a mess you are always making!\" The widow put in a good word for\\nme, but that warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well\\nenough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to\\nbe. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t\\none of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked\\nalong low-spirited and on the watch-out. I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\\nthrough the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\\nground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks. They had come up from the quarry\\nand stood around the stile awhile, and then went on around the garden\\nfence. It was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so. I\\ncouldn\\'t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to\\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I\\ndidn\\'t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in\\nthe left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.

I also thought that\\nshe rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took\\nevery opportunity of throwing in another. \"It is pleasant,\" said Mr. Skimpole, turning his sprightly eyes from\\none to the other of us, \"and it is whimsically interesting to trace\\npeculiarities in families. In this family we are all children, and I\\nam the youngest.\" The daughters, who appeared to be very fond of him, were amused by\\nthis droll fact, particularly the Comedy daughter. \"My dears, it is true,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"is it not? So it is, and\\nso it must be, because like the dogs in the hymn, \\'it is our nature\\nto.\\' Now, here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity\\nand a knowledge of details perfectly surprising. It will sound very\\nstrange in Miss Summerson\\'s ears, I dare say, that we know nothing\\nabout chops in this house. But we don\\'t, not the least. We can\\'t cook\\nanything whatever. A needle and thread we don\\'t know how to use. We\\nadmire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want, but we\\ndon\\'t quarrel with them. Then why should they quarrel with us? Live\\nand let live, we say to them. Live upon your practical wisdom, and\\nlet us live upon you!\" He laughed, but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what\\nhe said. \"We have sympathy, my roses,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"sympathy for\\neverything. Have we not?\" \"Oh, yes, papa!\" cried the three daughters. \"In fact, that is our family department,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"in this\\nhurly-burly of life. We are capable of looking on and of being\\ninterested, and we DO look on, and we ARE interested. What more can\\nwe do? Here is my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I\\ndare say her marrying another child, and having two more, was all\\nwrong in point of political economy, but it was very agreeable. We\\nhad our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social\\nideas. She brought her young husband home one day, and they and their\\nyoung fledglings have their nest upstairs. I dare say at some time or\\nother Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have\\nTHEIR nests upstairs too. So we get on, we don\\'t know how, but\\nsomehow.\"',\n",

(i don't want to go into detail since this isn't a porn thread). about 45 minutes later it's all done with. i was in pure shock... i couldn't believe i just had sex with my neighbor. in a way i felt bad but holy shit was that fun. we laid there for about 20 minutes afterwards and cuddled up a bit. she then said that i should probably get going since her husband was due to arrive within the hour. so i stood up, got dressed then it hit me that i never mowed the back yard. i reminded her and she responded with 'well it's no big deal, come finish it tomorrow', and winked at me. i just nodded and told her i will definitely come finish it tomorrow. i walked out through the garage and went home thinking about this craziness that just went down. i sat at home and thought i had to tell reddit. i couldn't go without sharing this with you guys. i've been up all night debating whether it was a good idea or not and finally gave in. \\n\\nhere's the thing though... i for sure have to go back tomorrow to finish the lawn. what if she comes on to me again?!? do i give in?? i feel a bit bad for having sex with some guys wife... then again he isn't doing anything to satisfy her. idk guys what do you think?\\n\\nupdate-jan 20th 1:20 pm: i'm walking over to her house in about 5 minutes i'll update you guys and tell you what comes of this shit storm.\\n\\nupdate-jan 20th 4:30 pm. so i went to her house and things were a bit normal. she answered the door and told me she was expecting me. she opened the garage door and i figured she just wanted to brush it off since nothing was mentioned. i did what i went to do and mowed the back yard as quick as possible since i just wanted to go home. once i was done i put everything back in its place and knocked on the door and told her i was done and ready to receive my payment. she usually pays me 40 bucks and calls it a day.  not today though... today she goes to in her pocket book and pulls out a hundred dollar bill and says i can have it, but i have to come in for a little... thoughts raced my mind... i wasn't sure what to do. but 100 bucks would be awesome! i gave in and walked inside. i for sure thought she was going to start trying to seduce me again. she didn't... actually she said 'okay, you can have this money but only if you promise to never speak of what happened yesterday to anybody' i was so happy! she just let it go. i told her that i agree and that it was just a thing and we got carried away, it won't happen again. we left it at that, as i was walking away she says 'but i'm keeping the video' i felt my heart sink and my face turn pale as i turned around and said 'excuse me?'. she starts laughing and says 'i'm just kidding!' i just laughed hysterically... i really hoped she was kidding. i said 'good one mrs.akers' and exited her house. \\nbut wait there's more! i went home got a shower and got dressed. i left my house, got some food, and went to my friends house (where i am now). i got a call from a random number about 20 minutes ago.. i picked it up and some man answered saying \\nman: 'hey is this (followed by my name)?' \\n\\nme: 'yeah what's up, who is this?. man: 'it's mr.akers, could you possibly come by my house later? i need to talk to you. my fucking hearted literally stopped. this is it! he fucking knows. idk. i'm dealing out! should i go?\\n\\ni told him i was at a friends house, if i'm back in the neighborhood at a decent time i'd stop in.\\n\\ni'm sitting here at my friends house freaking out. i told him the situation and he literally sounded so excited that i had sex with a milf. there's millions of things rushing through my head!! should i actually go?!?\\n\\n\\nupdate!! i wrote a part 2. http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2t4en6/tifu_and_became_a_homewrecker_part_2/\",\n",

       "array(['Hong Kong (CNN)Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong\\'s newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world\\'s second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. The monastery is funded entirely by Asia\\'s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who contributed $193 million from his personal foundation to the building project. The premises, styled on Tang dynasty buildings, sprawl across a lush, green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields. It can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily, but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong\\'s harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect \"important guests.\" \"We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks,\" Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. \"There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks,\" Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online.

       "       '(CNN)If you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this Valentine\\'s Day, it\\'s likely that they came from Kenya. The country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world, accounting for around 35% of all sales in the European Union. Famed for being long-lasting, Kenya\\'s roses, carnations and summer flowers are also popular in Russia and the U.S. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the World Floral Expo in Los Angeles. The event is one of the industry\\'s largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world, with several Ethiopian growers also representing the African continent alongside Kenya. The country\\'s flower power is attributed to its sunny climate, which enables high-quality blossoms to be grown year-round without the need for expensive-to-run greenhouses. Kenya also has excellent transport links to Europe, and from there, the rest of the world through Nairobi airport, which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables. This means that delicate floral cargo which is perishable in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly. More than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the Kenya Flower Council, with roughly half of the country\\'s 127 flower farms concentrated around Lake Naivasha, around 90 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. \"Naivasha is a big center because it\\'s a freshwater lake and it is not very far from Nairobi, which makes transport easy,\" says John Kihia, technical director of Floralife Africa, a company which provides hydration, transport and storage for the cut-flower industry. \"People have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place,\" he adds. Activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake, but local farmers have been working with the WWF in order to make sure that water levels are not affected: \"It\\'s about putting together a strong business case about why it\\'s good for growers to save water and ways to manage that,\" says Drew McVey, WWF technical adviser who calls the collaboration \"a story of success.\" Naivasha Lake\\'s location 1,884 meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium-sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of EU supermarkets, whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in Russia: \"It\\'s a consumer preference. In Moscow people will buy a single rose, so if it\\'s bigger it naturally looks more spectacular, whereas in the UK they buy bunches more often,\" says Kihia. Big business . Horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for Kenya, and the flower industry alone raked in around $600m last year, exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $507m in 2013. Nearly two thirds of exports are destined for Holland, where they are resold to florists through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers: \"If you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product, people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price,\" Kihia says. While Europe remains the biggest destination for Kenyan flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links, this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent, such as the recent recession. \"It has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand, which slows down business,\" says Jane Ngige, CEO of the Kenyan Flower Council. Kenyan exports also suffered when in October of last year the EU imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country, but the levy was lifted on Christmas Day allowing Kenyan producers to storm Valentine\\'s Day sales. Jane Ngige says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as Australia, Canada and Japan, and adds that direct flights from Nairobi airport play a crucial role in helping the Kenyan flower business take off globally: \"A direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality. It also makes it less expensive,\" she says. Kenyan growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring Rwanda by partnering with the country\\'s government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from Rwanda\\'s capital Kigali. It\\'s hoped that the park will eventually produce three million stems per year and kick-start Rwanda\\'s floriculture sector, which could pump more than $200 million into the country\\'s economy by 2017.

       "       '(CNN)A Pennsylvania State University fraternity has been suspended after allegedly posting on a private Facebook page compromising photos of women, including some who appeared to be asleep or passed out. The suspension of Kappa Delta Rho (KDR) fraternity comes as State College Police as well as university officials investigate the fraternity\\'s alleged use of the online page with up to 144 active members, including current and former students. \"No arrests are being made at this time,\" State College Police Lt. Keith Robb said. \"Unfortunately, we aren\\'t able to identify any suspects right now because the accounts on Facebook were sanitized, wiped clean.\" Robb said it has not yet been determined if any crime occurred. In a statement, college administrators said the fraternity\\'s local chapter had been suspended for one year by the Penn State Interfraternity Council and that police and university officials were investigating. The statement said the fraternity used the private Facebook page to post \"highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at Penn State.\" The images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose, others appeared incapacitated. \"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the University community\\'s values and expectations,\" the statement said. Penn State University President Eric Barron said in a separate statement Wednesday that the university will work with Kappa Delta Rho\\'s national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated. The university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at Penn State, Barron said. \"It ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a re-evaluation of the fraternity system is required,\" he said. \"Some members of the University senior leadership believe it is, and we are considering our options.\" David Clohessy, director of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university\\'s handling of sex crime reports. \"For years now, Penn State enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who\\'d listen that the university\\'s problematic culture about sex crimes had been \\'reformed,\" Clohessy said. \"The latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on Facebook, some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims.\" In 2012, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a  30- to 60-year prison term. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is appealing. \"The Kappa Delta Rho is a wake-up call,\" Clohessy said. \"But the Sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too.\" A former member of Kappa Delta Rho alerted police to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of \"unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing,\" according to a copy of a police affidavit. The drugs allegedly included \"marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication, and some cocaine,\" the affidavit said. The former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second Facebook page called \"2.0\" allegedly had been created around April 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it, the affidavit said. The earlier version of the page was titled \"Covert Business Transactions.\" Rape, nude photos, racist behavior: Do fraternities make men behave badly? The ex-frat member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, the affidavit said. The affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges, including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used. In the Sandusky case, the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by Sandusky -- either groped in a car, soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed. The scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and Penn State\\'s vaunted football program, including the dismissal of the late legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America\\'s highest-paid university presidents, Graham Spanier. It also tarnished Penn State\\'s celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics. \"We hope that Penn State officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students,\" said Clohessy, whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations. Attempts to reach the university and interfraternity council were unsuccessful. CNN\\'s Laura Ly and Sara Ganim contributed to this report.',\n",
       "       '(CNN)In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian-based Boko Haram has been accepted by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The 28-minute message, which cannot be independently authenticated by CNN, was posted online by ISIS supporters. The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated \"our jihadi brothers\" there. The spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, encourages people to join fighters in Africa if they cannot make it to Iraq or Syria. Boko Haram\\'s leader, Abubakar Shekau, announced in an audio message last week that the Islamist terror group was going to ally with ISIS. Jacob Zenn, a terror expert who lives in Nigeria, told CNN on Saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands,\" Zenn said. \"It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS\\'s biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram\\'s tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. What Boko Haram\\'s pledge of allegiance to ISIS means .

       "       '(CNN)The next time someone accuses you of acting like a Neanderthal, don\\'t be offended.  Just say \"thank you.\" A new study published this month suggests Neanderthals were more \"cognitively advanced than we give them credit,\" Kansas University\\'s David Frayer said in a release. Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger. Only recently, however, did Frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000-year-old bones as ones modified by humans. \"I was stunned,\" Frayer said of the discovery.  \"It\\'s so obvious that these are cut.\" The markings, including polishes and areas where the bones were \"rubbed together,\" show that the talons were \"manipulated into a piece of jewelry,\" Frayer said. Frayer co-wrote \"Evidence for Neanderthal Jewelry: Modified White-tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina\" with three other Croatian scientists. Their research indicates Neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in Geico commercials, but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an \"advanced level of prowess\" in catching birds, according to Frayer. \"We can\\'t prove it, but we suspect that they were catching these birds,\" he said. Even with modern technology, catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do.  Frayer believes Neanderthals must have had excellent \"planning skills and ritual\" they would\\'ve used in catching the bird. \"Neanderthals are often thought of to be simple-minded mumbling, bumbling, stumbling fools,\" Frayer said. \"But the more we know about them the more sophisticated they\\'ve become.\"',\n",
       "       'Lynchburg, Virginia  (CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative firebrand from Texas, became the first Republican to announce his campaign for the presidency, and he spent Monday morning telling a crowd at the largest Christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office, and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign. \"These are all of our stories,\" Cruz told the audience Monday, roaming around the circular stage at Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, opening his remarks by spotlighting his family history and his own path to Washington. \"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\" Cruz drew on the past only to focus on the future, repeatedly and emphatically asking the Liberty University student audience to \"imagine\" the U.S. under conservative leadership -- laying out his vision for the country and a Cruz presidency. The senator from Texas, who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to Obamacare and his willingness to shut down the federal government, presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment Republicans such as Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- candidates Cruz coyly refers to as the \"mushy middle.\" Monday\\'s event was the last part of a carefully coordinated media rollout, following Cruz\\'s announcement of his candidacy in a 30-second video message posted on Twitter shortly after midnight on Monday, roughly 24 hours after the Houston Chronicle first reported his planned announcement. Ten thousand students from Liberty University crowded into the university\\'s main arena for Cruz\\'s announcement. The venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give Cruz an early boost among evangelical voters, who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like Iowa and South Carolina that have early nominating contests. It was a youthful crowd, as students are required to attend the University\\'s tri-weekly convocation address. Not all in the audience were guaranteed Cruz supporters: Several attendees sported red \"Stand with Rand\" shirts, repping Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month. Jerry Falwell Jr., the university\\'s president and son of its founder and evangelical icon, introduced Cruz as a senator who \"has gone against the tide\" and a \"man of great character,\" all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office. Falwell picked up on Cruz\\'s assertion that millions of evangelical Christians did not vote in 2012, pointing out that \"if any candidate can energize that group, it will make a huge difference in any national race.\" Asked after the speech how he prepared for the event, Cruz said he \"spent some time in prayer\" thinking about the message he wants to convey. \"At the end of the day it\\'s listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around,\" Cruz told CNN, adding that he was \"incredibly\" encouraged and inspired by the support. Cruz\\'s announcement came on the five-year anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which Cruz has fought in the Senate to repeal. Cruz marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal \"every word\" of the healthcare law as president. Cruz also jabbed at Common Core education standards -- which Bush supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the IRS, instead suggesting Americans could file their taxes on a postcard. And Cruz drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to \"imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\" Cruz\\'s advisers envision a three-pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the tea party faction and competing in the libertarian and Christian conservative circles. A constant and vocal critic of the Obama administration, Cruz is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against Obamacare in 2013, which led to a tense standoff between Democrats and Republicans and ultimately resulted in a 17-day government shutdown. The showdown was punctuated by Cruz\\'s 21-hour speech on the Senate floor. While popular in conservative and tea party circles, Cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the GOP base, according to public opinion polls. A CNN/ORC International survey conducted this month on the hypothetical Republican primary showed Cruz came in with 4% support among Republicans and independents who lean Republican. But the field is still relatively open, with the top contender -- Bush -- coming in at 16% support, followed by Scott Walker at 13%. But Cruz has relatively strong favorability numbers. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he is viewed in a positive light by 45% of Republicans, compared with only 8% who don\\'t have a favorable opinion of him. Still, 46% say they haven\\'t heard enough about him to form an opinion. Jason Miller, an adviser to Cruz\\'s campaign, confirmed that the campaign\\'s fund-raising target is $40 million, and the campaign believes it can raise $1 million in the first week. Cruz this month finished an early-voting state tour to Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire -- and he\\'s scheduled to return to New Hampshire on March 28 to speak at a brunch in Rockingham County. Depending on the Senate schedule this week, he could possibly make more early-state trips, according to advisers. After his speech Monday, he\\'ll head up to New York for media appearances and a fund-raiser. Cruz developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in Texas as a little-known candidate, forcing then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment Republican. Along with two other first-term senators who are expected to run for president (Rand Paul and Marco Rubio), Cruz will likely face questions over experience, an issue that Republicans brought up in 2008 against Barack Obama, who was also a first-term senator at the time. Before running for the Senate in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- Cruz was solicitor general of Texas and argued before the Supreme Court. He graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Born in Canada to a Cuban father and American mother, Cruz was a dual citizen until he renounced Canadian citizenship in 2014. He faced questions over whether he would qualify for the presidency, though law experts consider him a natural-born citizen because he was born to an American mother. Cruz was swarmed by students and reporters after he descended the stage and started to exit the arena. He took photos and signed autographs for about a half hour, as his team tried to escort him through the crowd. One girl who was raising money selling baked goods offered to give Cruz a dozen cupcakes for free but he pulled out his wallet and gave her $20. A pair of enthusiastic sisters shouted out to Cruz to tell him that, like his own daughters, they were also named Caroline and Catherine and were two years apart. \"That\\'s just cool,\" he said, as he gave them both high fives. \"That is awesome.\" One student who said she was Hispanic said she and her whole family were behind him. \"You have the Hispanic vote,\" she joked, then proceeded to start talking to him Spanish. While Cruz\\'s father is Cuban, he\\'s not fluent in Spanish. \"We grew up speaking Spanglish. My grandmother would be like \\'Nino, throw me the remote control\\',\" he said This is who we are as a people. We got to tell that story,\" Cruz said.

       "       '(CNN)Roberto Mancini says he carries Manchester City\\'s supporters in his heart -- but there\\'s not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the Premier League champions. Manuel Pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current City manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season. Mancini, the man who led Manchester City to its first Premier League title in 44 years back in 2012 says Pellegrini is \"lucky\" to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning England\\'s top division. Pellegrini, who led City to the domestic title last season, is under fire with City trailing Chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the European Champions League. \"I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players,\" Inter Milan coach Mancini told CNN\\'s Don Riddell on the eve of City\\'s crucial game with Barcelona in the Champions League. \"I think City can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year.\" Nicknamed \"the Engineer,\" Pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side\\'s title charge in recent weeks. The Chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its Premier League title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow Burnley last weekend. His team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night. City faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the European Champions League -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season. It must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture. Only once in nine attempts has Barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged Champions League knockout tie and not progressed. Pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at City but a number of those purchases have failed to impress. Eliaquim Mangala, who arrived from Porto for $47million has endured a dismal first season in English football, while $32million man Stevan Jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from Fiorentina. \"It\\'s my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League,\" said Mancini. \"It\\'s in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it\\'s the best team. \"In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute,\" perhaps a nod to City\\'s last gasp English Premier League title win in 2012, thanks to Sergio Aguero\\'s stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers. \"I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title.\" Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes in December 2009, enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure. He led the club to the FA Cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season. Under Mancini, the club attracted star players such as Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Aguero. He signed a new five-year deal with the club in July 2012 but results dipped with rival Manchester United regaining the league title and City suffering a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wigan. Mancini was criticised for his side\\'s lack of success in the Champions League, where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties. The Italian, 50, was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with Carlos Tevez, the Argentina striker, which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the City squad. In the 12 Champions League ties under his stewardship, City managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team\\'s failure on the European stage. At the time of his sacking, the club said that Mancini failed to hit \"stated targets\" and that it wanted to \"develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football\". \"I had a fantastic time in England,\" he added. \"We won the Premier League after many years. I have all City\\'s supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this. \"Maybe I miss the Premier League because I worked there for three-and-a-half years. I built the team that is now in second position. \"I think they play with the same players and I am very proud of this.\" Mancini faces a struggle of his own at Inter with the club unlikely to qualify for European competition next season. Inter is eighth in Serie A and is eight points off the qualifying places for the Europa League. It faces German side Wolfsburg in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday having lost the first leg 3-1.',\n",
       "       'New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student\\'s application for an internship due to the South Asian nation\\'s \"rape problem.\" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn\\'t clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred \"many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons.\" \"It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,\" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. \"I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt.\" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig\\'s biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: \"What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?\" The post didn\\'t identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails\\' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: \"Unfortunately I don\\'t accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.\" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she \"never wrote\" such a message, claiming this email was \"put together from individual segments taken from different mails.\" \"I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, \" she added. \"I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way.\" Here\\'s what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate \"the laboratories are fully occupied.\" The Indian applicant \"didn\\'t accept\" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, \"I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now.\" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger referred to regular reports of \"multi-rape crimes\" and abuse of female tourists that, \"for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards (women).\" Such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male Indians \"and currently other European female associations are joining.\" \"Of course we cannot change or influence the Indian society,\" she added, \"but only take our consequences here in Europe.\" The idea that the professor wouldn\\'t accept male Indians for internships -- as reported by Quora and denied by the University of Leipzig -- riled up some in India, a number of whom wrote on the Quora thread. One user, identified as Sas Vijay, said, \"Don\\'t leave this issue. It is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds. File a complaint.\" Another user, posting as Hemanth Sriteja, wrote, \"I don\\'t wanna come to an era where I should say \\'Hii (sic), I\\'m from India, I\\'m not a rapist.\" One person echoing that view publicly is Michael Steiner, Germany\\'s ambassador to India. \"Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians,\" Steiner wrote Monday in a letter posted on the embassy website. \"Let\\'s be clear: India is not a country of rapists.\" The ambassador urged Beck-Sickinger \"to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which — in my opinion — is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher.\" CNN\\'s Harmeet Shah Sing and journalist Kunal Sehgal reported from India, and CNN\\'s Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

       "       '(CNN)The Palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of Israel, with images of missiles, terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across TV screens and newspapers. So you would think that security would be the central issue in Tuesday\\'s Israeli elections, right? The short answer is no. Poll after poll in Israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election. Indeed, even a majority of Israel\\'s Arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for Tuesday\\'s parliamentary poll, rather than advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What explains this apparent indifference? First, despite what the polls suggest, peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in Israeli politics. The main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue, and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks. Whatever they may say to pollsters, many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue. However, because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds, they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs, so their votes are not in play in these elections. This wasn\\'t always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left. However, for some time now, the majority of Israelis have shared a consensual position on the Palestinian question. In principle, they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process. However, in practice, that same majority believes that even if an Israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable, Israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile. Why? Experience has certainly taught middle Israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the Palestinians, irrespective of the complexion of the Israeli government. In 2000, for example, a Labor-led government agreed to a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, 97% of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, including the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount. Yet not only did Yasser Arafat reject the deal, but the Palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Add in the fact that subsequent unilateral Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon and Gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at Israeli civilians, and the 2008 decision by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reject Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\\'s peace proposal -- a plan similar to the Clinton parameters that Arafat rejected in 2000 -- and Israeli wariness is easy to understand. Since then, leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the Israeli public\\'s skepticism -- the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, only for Abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging American peace outline including this element, according to Israel\\'s Channel 2, even when he was presented with it directly by President Obama himself. As a result of all this, much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues, where voters hope political change in Israel can actually make a real difference to their lives. Indeed, the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is Moshe Kahlon\\'s centrist party Kulanu, whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in Israel. (Kahlon won fame in Israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market.) In keeping with the mood of the public, the ex-Likudnik presents a moderate image on the Palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security. In fact, one senior Israeli official told me that Kahlon\\'s team has been advised against even mentioning the word \"peace\" for the rest of the campaign. That says it all.',\n",
       "       'It was in vain for me to say, \"Now, Stubbs, I\\nfeel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride\\na little while,\" for the moment I left him, he stood stock still\\nagain. Consequently I was obliged to lead the way, as before; and in\\nthis order we returned home, to the great delight of the village. Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages, I\\nam sure, for in a week\\'s time the people were so glad to see us go\\nby, though ever so frequently in the course of a day, that there were\\nfaces of greeting in every cottage. I had known many of the grown\\npeople before and almost all the children, but now the very steeple\\nbegan to wear a familiar and affectionate look. Among my new friends\\nwas an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and\\nwhitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on\\nits hinges, it shut up the whole house-front. This old lady had a\\ngrandson who was a sailor, and I wrote a letter to him for her and\\ndrew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him\\nup and where his old stool yet occupied its old place. This was\\nconsidered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the\\nworld, but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth, in\\nwhich he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way\\nto America, and from America would write again, I got all the credit\\nthat ought to have been given to the post-office and was invested\\nwith the merit of the whole system. Thus, what with being so much in the air, playing with so many\\nchildren, gossiping with so many people, sitting on invitation in so\\nmany cottages, going on with Charley\\'s education, and writing long\\nletters to Ada every day, I had scarcely any time to think about that\\nlittle loss of mine and was almost always cheerful. If I did think of\\nit at odd moments now and then, I had only to be busy and forget it. I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said,\\n\"Mother, why is the lady not a pretty lady now like she used to be?\" But when I found the child was not less fond of me, and drew its soft\\nhand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch,\\nthat soon set me up again. There were many little occurrences which\\nsuggested to me, with great consolation, how natural it is to gentle\\nhearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority. One of\\nthese particularly touched me. I happened to stroll into the little\\nchurch when a marriage was just concluded, and the young couple had\\nto sign the register. The bridegroom, to whom the pen was handed first, made a rude cross\\nfor his mark; the bride, who came next, did the same. Now, I had\\nknown the bride when I was last there, not only as the prettiest girl\\nin the place, but as having quite distinguished herself in the\\nschool, and I could not help looking at her with some surprise. She\\ncame aside and whispered to me, while tears of honest love and\\nadmiration stood in her bright eyes, \"He\\'s a dear good fellow, miss;\\nbut he can\\'t write yet--he\\'s going to learn of me--and I wouldn\\'t\\nshame him for the world!\" Why, what had I to fear, I thought, when\\nthere was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man\\'s daughter! The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown,\\nand the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my\\nold one. Charley was wonderful to see, she was so radiant and so\\nrosy; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole\\nnight. There was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of Chesney Wold\\nwhere a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view. The wood had\\nbeen cleared and opened to improve this point of sight, and the\\nbright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at\\nleast once every day. A picturesque part of the Hall, called the\\nGhost\\'s Walk, was seen to advantage from this higher ground; and the\\nstartling name, and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had\\nheard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it, mingled with the view and\\ngave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real\\ncharms. There was a bank here, too, which was a famous one for\\nviolets; and as it was a daily delight of Charley\\'s to gather wild\\nflowers, she took as much to the spot as I did. It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house\\nor never went inside it. The family were not there, I had heard on my\\narrival, and were not expected. I was far from being incurious or\\nuninterested about the building; on the contrary, I often sat in this\\nplace wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a\\nfootstep really did resound at times, as the story said, upon the\\nlonely Ghost\\'s Walk. The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock\\nhad impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the\\nhouse even when she was absent. I am not sure. Her face and figure\\nwere associated with it, naturally; but I cannot say that they\\nrepelled me from it, though something did.',\n",
       "       '\\nOn a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was\\nsinging in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan\\ndistances \"above the Forties,\" of a new Opera House which should\\ncompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European\\ncapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every\\nwinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy. Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus\\nkeeping out the \"new people\" whom New York was beginning to dread and\\nyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic\\nassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so\\nproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music. It was Madame Nilsson\\'s first appearance that winter, and what the\\ndaily press had already learned to describe as \"an exceptionally\\nbrilliant audience\" had gathered to hear her, transported through the\\nslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family\\nlandau, or in the humbler but more convenient \"Brown coupe.\" To come to\\nthe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\\nas in one\\'s own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in\\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\\none\\'s own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy. It was\\none of the great livery-stableman\\'s most masterly intuitions to have\\ndiscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more\\nquickly than they want to get to it. When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no reason why\\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\\ncigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.\\nArcher allowed smoking. But, in the first place, New York was a\\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \"not the\\nthing\" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not \"the\\nthing\" played a part as important in Newland Archer\\'s New York as the\\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\\nforefathers thousands of years ago. The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had dawdled\\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\\nrealisation. This was especially the case when the pleasure was a\\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\\ndonna\\'s stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more\\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  \"He loves me--he\\nloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--\" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\\nwith notes as clear as dew. She sang, of course, \"M\\'ama!\" and not \"he loves me,\" since an\\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\\nGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be\\ntranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding of\\nEnglish-speaking audiences. This seemed as natural to Newland Archer\\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole. \"M\\'ama ... non m\\'ama ...\" the prima donna sang, and \"M\\'ama! \", with a\\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\\nthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\\nvictim. Newland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\\nhouse. Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott,\\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\\nattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\\nby some of the younger members of the family. On this occasion, the\\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott, and her daughter, Mrs. Welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\\nfixed on the stagelovers. As Madame Nilsson\\'s \"M\\'ama!\" thrilled out\\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\\nDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl\\'s cheek, mantled her brow\\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\\nsingle gardenia. She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw her\\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly. He drew a breath of\\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage. No expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\\nOpera houses of Paris and Vienna. The foreground, to the footlights,\\nwas covered with emerald green cloth. In the middle distance\\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\\nand red roses. Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank\\'s far-off\\nprodigies. In the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white\\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul\\'s\\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\\nthe right wing. \"The darling!\"',\n",
       "       'But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.\\nJackson\\'s breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\\nwhat he wanted to know. The club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts\\'s opera-glass. For a moment he\\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\\ntwist, and said simply:  \"I didn\\'t think the Mingotts would have tried\\nit on.\" Newland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a\\nstrange state of embarrassment. It was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided\\nattention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothed\\nwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not\\nidentify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presence\\ncreated such excitement among the initiated. Then light dawned on him,\\nand with it came a momentary rush of indignation. No, indeed; no one\\nwould have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on! But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind\\nhim left no doubt in Archer\\'s mind that the young woman was May\\nWelland\\'s cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as \"poor\\nEllen Olenska.\" Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe\\na day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not\\ndisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying\\nwith old Mrs. Mingott. Archer entirely approved of family solidarity,\\nand one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their\\nresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock\\nhad produced. There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man\\'s\\nheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by\\nfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but\\nto receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing\\nfrom producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the\\nvery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer,\\nwas to be announced within a few weeks. No, he felt as old Sillerton\\nJackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on! He knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenue\\'s\\nlimits) that old Mrs. Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, would\\ndare. He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in\\nspite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with a\\nfather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough\\nto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the\\nwealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to \"foreigners\" (an\\nItalian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch to\\nher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone\\n(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in\\nthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park. Old Mrs. Mingott\\'s foreign daughters had become a legend. They never\\ncame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons\\nof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her\\nhabit, had philosophically remained at home. But the cream-coloured\\nhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisian\\naristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she\\nthroned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the\\nTuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as\\nplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above\\nThirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened like\\ndoors instead of sashes that pushed up. Every one (including Mr. Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that old\\nCatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York,\\njustified every success, and excused a certain number of failings. Unkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won her\\nway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of\\nhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency\\nand dignity of her private life. Mr. Manson Mingott had died when she\\nwas only twenty-eight, and had \"tied up\" the money with an additional\\ncaution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold young\\nwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,\\nmarried her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable\\ncircles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarly\\nwith Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend of\\nMme. Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first to\\nproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only\\nrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier\\nCatherine. Mrs. Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband\\'s\\nfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of\\nher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when\\nshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it\\nshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the\\ntransient pleasures of the table. Therefore, for totally different\\nreasons, her food was as poor as Mrs. Archer\\'s, and her wines did\\nnothing to redeem it. Her relatives considered that the penury of her\\ntable discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associated\\nwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the\\n\"made dishes\" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of\\nher son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the\\nbest chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  \"What\\'s the use of\\ntwo good cooks in one family, now that I\\'ve married the girls and can\\'t\\neat sauces?\" Newland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his\\neyes toward the Mingott box. He saw that Mrs. Welland and her\\nsister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the\\nMingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,\\nand that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due\\nto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of\\nthe situation. As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully\\nin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,\\nas she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New York\\nwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for\\nwishing to pass unnoticed. Few things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against\\n\"Taste,\" that far-off divinity of whom \"Form\" was the mere visible\\nrepresentative and vicegerent. Madame Olenska\\'s pale and serious face\\nappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy\\nsituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from\\nher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him. He hated to think of May\\nWelland\\'s being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless\\nof the dictates of Taste.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nThe news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the\\npeople tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them\\nputting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle\\nof a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would\\nsay, over a fence:\\n\\n\"Is it _them?_\"\\n\\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\\n\\n\"You bet it is.\" When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\\nthree girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but\\nthat don\\'t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her\\nface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her\\nuncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped\\nfor them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they _had_\\nit! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet\\nagain at last and have such good times. Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then\\nhe looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs;\\nso then him and the duke, with a hand across each other\\'s shoulder,\\nand t\\'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there,\\neverybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise\\nstopping, people saying \"\\'Sh!\" and all the men taking their hats off\\nand drooping their heads, so you could \\'a\\' heard a pin fall. And when\\nthey got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one\\nsight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could \\'a\\' heard them to\\nOrleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\\'s necks,\\nand hung their chins over each other\\'s shoulders; and then for three\\nminutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that\\ndamp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of\\nthe coffin, and t\\'other on t\\'other side, and they kneeled down and\\nrested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to\\nthemselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you\\nnever see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to\\nsobbing right out loud--the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly,\\nwent up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn,\\non the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up\\ntowards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and\\nwent off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never\\nsee anything so disgusting. Well, by and by the king he gets up and\\ncomes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a\\nspeech, all full of tears and flapdoodle, about its being a sore trial\\nfor him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing\\ndiseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it\\'s\\na trial that\\'s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy\\nand these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out\\nof his brother\\'s heart, because out of their mouths they can\\'t, words\\nbeing too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it\\nwas just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen,\\nand turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust. And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the\\ncrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their\\nmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church\\nletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and\\nhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and\\nbully. Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\\nnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the\\nfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up\\nwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying\\nyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that\\nwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he\\nwill name the same, to wit, as follows, viz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and\\nDeacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi\\nBell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley. Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\\ntogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to\\nt\\'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was\\naway up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so\\nthey all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked\\nto him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn\\'t say\\nnothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel\\nof sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said\\n\"Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo\" all the time, like a baby that can\\'t talk. So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty\\nmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts\\nof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to\\nGeorge\\'s family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote\\nhim the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them\\nout of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat. Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the\\nking he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house\\nand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the\\ntanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other\\nhouses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand\\ndollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand\\ncash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said they\\'d go and fetch\\nit up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come\\nwith a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found\\nthe bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all\\nthem yaller-boys. My, the way the king\\'s eyes did shine!',\n",
       "       'If he drank\\nnow and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or\\na pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to\\nlook at a beer-stained pink \"sporting paper,\" with pictures of murderers\\nand half-naked women. It was for such pleasures as these that he spent\\nhis money; and such was his life during the six weeks and a half that he\\ntoiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable them to break the grip of\\ntheir teamsters\\' union. In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of\\nthe laborers. On an average, the tunneling cost a life a day and several\\nmanglings; it was seldom, however, that more than a dozen or two men\\nheard of any one accident. The work was all done by the new boring\\nmachinery, with as little blasting as possible; but there would be\\nfalling rocks and crushed supports, and premature explosions--and in\\naddition all the dangers of railroading. So it was that one night, as\\nJurgis was on his way out with his gang, an engine and a loaded car\\ndashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him\\nupon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete wall and knocking\\nhim senseless. When he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of\\nan ambulance. He was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was\\nthreading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds. They took\\nhim to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he\\nwas washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of\\nmaimed and mangled men. Jurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest\\nChristmas he had had in America. Every year there were scandals and\\ninvestigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that doctors\\nwere allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients; but Jurgis\\nknew nothing of this--his only complaint was that they used to feed him\\nupon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in Packingtown would\\nfeed to his dog. Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned\\ncorned beef and \"roast beef\" of the stockyards; now he began to\\nunderstand--that it was what you might call \"graft meat,\" put up to\\nbe sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and\\nsailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, \"shantymen\" and gangs of\\nrailroad laborers. Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks. This\\ndid not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to\\nwork, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and\\nthat his place was needed for some one worse off than he. That he was\\nutterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the\\nmeantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities,\\nnor any one else in the city. As it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his\\nlast week\\'s board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance of\\nhis Saturday\\'s pay. He had less than seventy-five cents in his pockets,\\nand a dollar and a half due him for the day\\'s work he had done before he\\nwas hurt. He might possibly have sued the company, and got some damages\\nfor his injuries, but he did not know this, and it was not the company\\'s\\nbusiness to tell him. He went and got his pay and his tools, which he\\nleft in a pawnshop for fifty cents. Then he went to his landlady,\\nwho had rented his place and had no other for him; and then to his\\nboardinghouse keeper, who looked him over and questioned him. As he must\\ncertainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded there only\\nsix weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be worth the risk\\nto keep him on trust. So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight. It was\\nbitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his face. He had no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five\\ncents in his pocket, with the certainty that he could not earn another\\ncent for months. The snow meant no chance to him now; he must walk along\\nand see others shoveling, vigorous and active--and he with his left arm\\nbound to his side! He could not hope to tide himself over by odd jobs\\nof loading trucks; he could not even sell newspapers or carry satchels,\\nbecause he was now at the mercy of any rival. Words could not paint the\\nterror that came over him as he realized all this. He was like a wounded\\nanimal in the forest; he was forced to compete with his enemies upon\\nunequal terms. There would be no consideration for him because of his\\nweakness--it was no one\\'s business to help him in such distress, to make\\nthe fight the least bit easier for him. Even if he took to begging, he\\nwould be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he was to discover in good\\ntime.',\n",

       "array(['(CNN)A group of medical students -- including an American, seven Britons and a Canadian -- may be the latest Westerners to join ISIS. It\\'s become a familiar story: Young people give up their futures in Western democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self-declared Islamic state in the Middle East. Last month, three teenage British girls suspected of wanting to join ISIS may have gone to Syria, authorities said. Their fates remain unknown. An estimated 3,400 Westerners have gone to join ISIS in its bloody quest to establish an Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, said Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Analysts and U.S. officials agree: ISIS is skilled at luring Westerners, attracting far greater numbers than al Qaeda.  How is it doing this? ISIS recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. \"The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,\" counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett wrote last year in a report called \"Foreign fighters in Syria.\" Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East studies at The London School of Economics, put it more bluntly: . \"ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip.\" Many recruits come from educated, well-to-do backgrounds, like 25-year-old Abu Anwar of Britain. He said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join ISIS. \"I\\'m from the south of England. I grew up in a middle-class family,\" he told CNN. \"Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is, you cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape.\" The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife. Others may succumb to more tangible promises. ISIS loyalists are told they will receive gifts from Allah, wrote Aqsa Mahmood, a young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS and now is an ISIS recruiter. Such gifts include \"a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,\" Mahmood wrote. ISIS\\' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hourlong video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ISIS now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \"It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following,\" he said. Even the U.S. State Department admits ISIS\\' propaganda prowess \"is something we have not seen before.\" \"It\\'s something we need to do a lot more work on,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last month. \"We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we\\'re combating.\" \"We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,\" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of \"Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,\" told CNN last year.  \"... It is very attractive for angry young Muslims when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them.\" The slick strategy offers a big edge over al Qaeda.  ISIS \"has proven far more adept than core al Qaeda -- or any of al Qaeda\\'s affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience,\" Rasmussen said. Recruits are also being lured by ISIS\\' success in its endeavor to create an Islamic state, analysts say. The intelligence community determined that ISIS\\' battlefield successes gave it \"some recruitment success,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in September. \"Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting,\" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. \"This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield,\" said Steve Hassan,  founder of Freedom of Mind, a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. \"But in fact, it\\'s a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers.\" That type of brainwashing is what turned Canadian Damian Clairmont into an ISIS militant, said his mother, Christianne Boudreau. \"It\\'s so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\" she said. Clairmont died fighting in Syria last year. While ISIS\\' recruiting success gets a lot of attention, it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young Westerners. About 130 Canadian citizens have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, Canada\\'s intelligence agency estimated last year. About 1,200 French fighters have joined ISIS as well.  Roughly 600 British nationals are believed to have gone to Iraq and Syria, according to research groups, along with another 600 from Germany. In the United States, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. But it\\'s unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Once foreigners go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS, their odds of going back to their families can be slim. Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. Western leaders acknowledge there\\'s work to do. \"It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said last year. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants\\' messaging. \"We\\'re seeing their approaches continue to evolve,\" Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told CNN. \"We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we\\'re combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource.\" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. \"We\\'re really going to pick it up now,\" Psaki said. \"We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months.\" Several anti-ISIS efforts are already in place. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, said Barrett, the counterterrorism expert. And U.S. State Department official Richard Stengel said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining. \"They\\'re reading the messages, they\\'re hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing,\" Stengel said in October. But Barrett said some officials might not be doing as much as they think. \"Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own.\" CNN\\'s Josh Levs, Joshua Berlinger, Paula Newton, Jethro Mullen, Catherine E.

       "       '(CNN)A Pennsylvania State University fraternity has been suspended after allegedly posting on a private Facebook page compromising photos of women, including some who appeared to be asleep or passed out. The suspension of Kappa Delta Rho (KDR) fraternity comes as State College Police as well as university officials investigate the fraternity\\'s alleged use of the online page with up to 144 active members, including current and former students. \"No arrests are being made at this time,\" State College Police Lt. Keith Robb said. \"Unfortunately, we aren\\'t able to identify any suspects right now because the accounts on Facebook were sanitized, wiped clean.\" Robb said it has not yet been determined if any crime occurred. In a statement, college administrators said the fraternity\\'s local chapter had been suspended for one year by the Penn State Interfraternity Council and that police and university officials were investigating. The statement said the fraternity used the private Facebook page to post \"highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at Penn State.\" The images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose, others appeared incapacitated. \"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the University community\\'s values and expectations,\" the statement said. Penn State University President Eric Barron said in a separate statement Wednesday that the university will work with Kappa Delta Rho\\'s national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated. The university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at Penn State, Barron said. \"It ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a re-evaluation of the fraternity system is required,\" he said. \"Some members of the University senior leadership believe it is, and we are considering our options.\" David Clohessy, director of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university\\'s handling of sex crime reports. \"For years now, Penn State enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who\\'d listen that the university\\'s problematic culture about sex crimes had been \\'reformed,\" Clohessy said. \"The latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on Facebook, some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims.\" In 2012, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a  30- to 60-year prison term. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is appealing. \"The Kappa Delta Rho is a wake-up call,\" Clohessy said. \"But the Sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too.\" A former member of Kappa Delta Rho alerted police to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of \"unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing,\" according to a copy of a police affidavit. The drugs allegedly included \"marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication, and some cocaine,\" the affidavit said. The former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second Facebook page called \"2.0\" allegedly had been created around April 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it, the affidavit said. The earlier version of the page was titled \"Covert Business Transactions.\" Rape, nude photos, racist behavior: Do fraternities make men behave badly? The ex-frat member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, the affidavit said. The affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges, including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used. In the Sandusky case, the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by Sandusky -- either groped in a car, soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed. The scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and Penn State\\'s vaunted football program, including the dismissal of the late legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America\\'s highest-paid university presidents, Graham Spanier. It also tarnished Penn State\\'s celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics. \"We hope that Penn State officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students,\" said Clohessy, whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations. Attempts to reach the university and interfraternity council were unsuccessful. CNN\\'s Laura Ly and Sara Ganim contributed to this report.',\n",
       "       '(CNN)In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian-based Boko Haram has been accepted by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The 28-minute message, which cannot be independently authenticated by CNN, was posted online by ISIS supporters. The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated \"our jihadi brothers\" there. The spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, encourages people to join fighters in Africa if they cannot make it to Iraq or Syria. Boko Haram\\'s leader, Abubakar Shekau, announced in an audio message last week that the Islamist terror group was going to ally with ISIS. Jacob Zenn, a terror expert who lives in Nigeria, told CNN on Saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands,\" Zenn said. \"It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS\\'s biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram\\'s tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. What Boko Haram\\'s pledge of allegiance to ISIS means .

       "       '(CNN)When it comes to the U.S. fraternity and sorority system, it\\'s a disturbing truth: Life is largely segregated by race, money and power; and, yet, most of us find that unsurprising. This week, however, we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change. The push came in the form of a nine-second YouTube video, which I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen by now. It reportedly shows members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting these chilling lines: \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" \"The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant,\" CNN\\'s Eliott C. McLaughlin writes, describing a clip that rocketed around social media, leading OU\\'s president, David Boren, to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school. The video is hard to watch, but I have a feeling it\\'s one we need to see, both because it hints at the inner workings of certain Greek organizations, and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the United States. I\\'m thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public. That alone should give some reason for hope. Others weren\\'t, but I was shocked by the video. This, in 2015? In my home state? Both of my parents participated in Greek life in Oklahoma, but at a different university. I know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement. What happened on the bus at OU doesn\\'t negate their positive experiences. But it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion. Sometimes students are excluded from Greek life, in theory, because they\\'re seen as uncool or don\\'t \"fit in\" with a particular chapter. But we\\'d be kidding ourselves if we didn\\'t realize that, often, a person\\'s race -- or sexual orientation, for that matter --  factors into this you\\'re-in, you\\'re-out process. Oklahoma school\\'s response to video caught between racism, Civil Rights Act . And it\\'s hard for me not to see the SAE video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology. This is a case of dangerous group-think run amok. In a system that remains largely divided by race, perhaps videos like this shouldn\\'t be so surprising. That\\'s the view of Matthew Hughey, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who studies racial dynamics in American Greek life. The U.S. fraternity and sorority system is \"a form of American apartheid,\" he told me in an interview on Monday. Instead of thinking of the Oklahoma fraternity members as \"bad apples,\" he said, we should see them as part of a \"bad orchard.\" That orchard includes, but isn\\'t limited to, Greek organizations, he told me. It also includes the rest of us and our country\\'s racist history. \"Largely, these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world,\" he said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . Comparative data on the racial make-up of these organizations is impossible to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race. From 2003 to 2006, Hughey spent time interviewing students from Greek organizations at three colleges on the East Coast. \"At the time of interviews, the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members, and there was an average of 2.4 nonwhite members per organization,\" he wrote in a 2010 paper published by Society for the Study of Social Problems. That\\'s 3.8% minority members, in those instances. Hughey\\'s sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who\\'s spent time on a college campus knows to be true: There are white fraternities and there are black ones. Sometimes we even dare call them that. Far too many of us, especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in Greek life, either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism, sexism and violence in the U.S. Greek system as somehow isolated. It\\'s clear that\\'s not the case. \"In 1992, Texas A&M University fined its chapter $1,000 after it threw a \\'jungle party\\' attended by frat brothers in blackface. Then in 2002, Syracuse University suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface. As recently as 2013, the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed African American students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs,\" according to The Washington Post\\'s Terrence McCoy. All of that was just SAE. Other examples are easy to come by, too. According to The New York Daily News, here\\'s the text of an invitation to a 2013 Asian-themed Kappa Sigma party at Duke University: \"We look forward to having Mi, Yu, You and Yo Friends over for some Sake. Chank You.\" And in January 2014, according to The New York Times, Arizona State University investigated an MLK-day party hosted by the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in which \"nonblack students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs and drinking from hollowed-out watermelons.\" It\\'s clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing. One easy place to start would be simply getting more information. Why don\\'t universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is? Hughey told me that data isn\\'t available. Then we could know the answers to some interesting questions: How segregated are Greek organizations? Are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others? What\\'s the trend over time? Is there progress? John Lewis on Oklahoma students: \\'They should be gone\\' Universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations. Do traditionally black and Latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats? If not, why? And why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place? What does that do to the student body as a whole? I\\'m not calling for an end to the Greek system. But it\\'s a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes. \"Any time there are racist remarks made, we must speak up as Americans,\" Boren, the OU president, said in a news conference. He added that he hopes the SAE students \"think long and hard\" about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week. \"I hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people,\" he said. The rest of us should do that, too.',\n",
       "       '(CNN)The next time someone accuses you of acting like a Neanderthal, don\\'t be offended.  Just say \"thank you.\" A new study published this month suggests Neanderthals were more \"cognitively advanced than we give them credit,\" Kansas University\\'s David Frayer said in a release. Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger. Only recently, however, did Frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000-year-old bones as ones modified by humans. \"I was stunned,\" Frayer said of the discovery.  \"It\\'s so obvious that these are cut.\" The markings, including polishes and areas where the bones were \"rubbed together,\" show that the talons were \"manipulated into a piece of jewelry,\" Frayer said. Frayer co-wrote \"Evidence for Neanderthal Jewelry: Modified White-tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina\" with three other Croatian scientists. Their research indicates Neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in Geico commercials, but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an \"advanced level of prowess\" in catching birds, according to Frayer. \"We can\\'t prove it, but we suspect that they were catching these birds,\" he said. Even with modern technology, catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do.  Frayer believes Neanderthals must have had excellent \"planning skills and ritual\" they would\\'ve used in catching the bird. \"Neanderthals are often thought of to be simple-minded mumbling, bumbling, stumbling fools,\" Frayer said. \"But the more we know about them the more sophisticated they\\'ve become.\"',\n",

There\\'s no movie yet, but \"Community\\'s\" much-awaited sixth season made its debut. Not even cancellation by NBC could kill the fan favorite sitcom, as Yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early Tuesday. The show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to Yahoo, though cast member Yvette Nicole Brown (now on CBS\\' \"The Odd Couple\") had to leave the show for family reasons. The premiere briefly touches on this in its own way, with Shirley\\'s absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff (as the character Abed points out, along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode). The \"new Shirley,\" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster\\'s Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie. And how about the end of the first episode, which gave us a look at the spinoff, \"The Butcher and the Baker,\" with Shirley and Steven Weber as a Southern lawyer? Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton\\'s adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta\\'s parents. Most interesting was the introduction of Keith David as \\'90s tech genius Elroy. Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Amy Amatangelo saying, \"Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue.\" Time\\'s James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, \"The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.\" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.',\n",
       "       'New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student\\'s application for an internship due to the South Asian nation\\'s \"rape problem.\" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn\\'t clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred \"many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons.\" \"It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,\" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. \"I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt.\" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig\\'s biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: \"What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?\" The post didn\\'t identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails\\' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: \"Unfortunately I don\\'t accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.\" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she \"never wrote\" such a message, claiming this email was \"put together from individual segments taken from different mails.\" \"I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, \" she added. \"I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way.\" Here\\'s what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate \"the laboratories are fully occupied.\" The Indian applicant \"didn\\'t accept\" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, \"I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now.\" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger referred to regular reports of \"multi-rape crimes\" and abuse of female tourists that, \"for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards (women).\" Such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male Indians \"and currently other European female associations are joining.\" \"Of course we cannot change or influence the Indian society,\" she added, \"but only take our consequences here in Europe.\" The idea that the professor wouldn\\'t accept male Indians for internships -- as reported by Quora and denied by the University of Leipzig -- riled up some in India, a number of whom wrote on the Quora thread. One user, identified as Sas Vijay, said, \"Don\\'t leave this issue. It is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds. File a complaint.\" Another user, posting as Hemanth Sriteja, wrote, \"I don\\'t wanna come to an era where I should say \\'Hii (sic), I\\'m from India, I\\'m not a rapist.\" One person echoing that view publicly is Michael Steiner, Germany\\'s ambassador to India. \"Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians,\" Steiner wrote Monday in a letter posted on the embassy website. \"Let\\'s be clear: India is not a country of rapists.\" The ambassador urged Beck-Sickinger \"to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which — in my opinion — is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher.\" CNN\\'s Harmeet Shah Sing and journalist Kunal Sehgal reported from India, and CNN\\'s Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

       "       '(CNN)The Palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of Israel, with images of missiles, terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across TV screens and newspapers. So you would think that security would be the central issue in Tuesday\\'s Israeli elections, right? The short answer is no. Poll after poll in Israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election. Indeed, even a majority of Israel\\'s Arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for Tuesday\\'s parliamentary poll, rather than advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What explains this apparent indifference? First, despite what the polls suggest, peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in Israeli politics. The main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue, and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks. Whatever they may say to pollsters, many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue. However, because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds, they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs, so their votes are not in play in these elections. This wasn\\'t always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left. However, for some time now, the majority of Israelis have shared a consensual position on the Palestinian question. In principle, they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process. However, in practice, that same majority believes that even if an Israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable, Israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile. Why? Experience has certainly taught middle Israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the Palestinians, irrespective of the complexion of the Israeli government. In 2000, for example, a Labor-led government agreed to a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, 97% of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, including the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount. Yet not only did Yasser Arafat reject the deal, but the Palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Add in the fact that subsequent unilateral Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon and Gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at Israeli civilians, and the 2008 decision by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reject Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\\'s peace proposal -- a plan similar to the Clinton parameters that Arafat rejected in 2000 -- and Israeli wariness is easy to understand. Since then, leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the Israeli public\\'s skepticism -- the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, only for Abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging American peace outline including this element, according to Israel\\'s Channel 2, even when he was presented with it directly by President Obama himself. As a result of all this, much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues, where voters hope political change in Israel can actually make a real difference to their lives. Indeed, the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is Moshe Kahlon\\'s centrist party Kulanu, whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in Israel. (Kahlon won fame in Israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market.) In keeping with the mood of the public, the ex-Likudnik presents a moderate image on the Palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security. In fact, one senior Israeli official told me that Kahlon\\'s team has been advised against even mentioning the word \"peace\" for the rest of the campaign. That says it all.',\n",

We\\'d\\n_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went\\na-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\\ntoo--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim\\nsaid he didn\\'t believe he could go any farther--so scared he hadn\\'t\\nhardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left\\non this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again.

When we got pretty close to the\\ncross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely\\nsee her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would \\'a\\' been\\naboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his\\nhead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was\\ngone; but he jerked it in again, and says:\\n\\n\"Heave that blame lantern out o\\' sight, Bill!\" He flung a bag of\\nsomething into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was\\nPackard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard says, in a low\\nvoice:\\n\\n\"All ready--shove off!\" I couldn\\'t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Hold on--\\'d you go through him?\" \"No. Didn\\'t you?\" \"No. So he\\'s got his share o\\' the cash yet.\" \"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\" \"Say, won\\'t he suspicion what we\\'re up to?\" \"Maybe he won\\'t.

He was very strong\\nand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood\\naway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green\\nlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell\\ntoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry\\nout joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade\\nof moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He\\nshowed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade\\nand stirred the earth and let the air in. They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses\\nwhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation\\nof surprise. \"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \"Who did that\\nthere?\" It was one of Mary\\'s own little clearings round the pale green points. \"I did it,\" said Mary. \"Why, I thought tha\\' didn\\'t know nothin\\' about gardenin\\',\" he exclaimed. \"I don\\'t,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and the grass was so\\nthick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe.

It tires me too much.\" \"Does your father come and see you?\" Mary ventured. \"Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn\\'t want to see me.\" \"Why?\" Mary could not help asking again. A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy\\'s face. \"My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at\\nme. He thinks I don\\'t know, but I\\'ve heard people talking. He almost\\nhates me.\" \"He hates the garden, because she died,\" said Mary half speaking to\\nherself. \"What garden?\" the boy asked. \"Oh! just--just a garden she used to like,\" Mary stammered. \"Have you\\nbeen here always?\" \"Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to\\nplaces at the seaside, but I won\\'t stay because people stare at me. I\\nused to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor\\ncame from London to see me and said it was stupid. He told them to\\ntake it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I\\ndon\\'t want to go out.\" \"I didn\\'t when first I came here,\" said Mary. \"Why do you keep looking\\nat me like that?\" \"Because of the dreams that are so real,\" he answered rather fretfully.',\n",
       "       'And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff,\\nand there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and\\nsafe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased\\nhim so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at\\nfirst Mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself, with his\\nbig eyes and heavy locks of hair. \"I did not know birds could be like that,\" he said. \"But if you stay\\nin a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel\\nas if you had been inside that garden.\" She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He\\nevidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a\\nsurprise. \"I am going to let you look at something,\" he said. \"Do you see that\\nrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?\" Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a\\ncurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"There is a cord hanging from it,\" said Colin. \"Go and pull it.\" Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it\\nthe silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a\\npicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had\\nbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were\\nexactly like Colin\\'s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big\\nas they really were because of the black lashes all round them. \"She is my mother,\" said Colin complainingly. \"I don\\'t see why she\\ndied. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.\" \"How queer!\" said Mary. \"If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,\" he\\ngrumbled. \"I dare say I should have lived, too.

       "       'There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and\\nended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she\\nwould slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were\\nany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when\\nshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she\\nheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it\\nwas. It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she\\nstopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back\\nagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy\\nabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such\\nround and such blue eyes in any boy\\'s face. And on the trunk of the\\ntree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him,\\nand from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up\\nand sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they\\nwere all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little\\ncall his pipe seemed to make. When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost\\nas low as and rather like his piping. \"Don\\'t tha\\' move,\" he said. \"It\\'d flight \\'em.\" Mary remained\\nmotionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the\\nground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were\\nmoving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel\\nscampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew\\nhis head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away,\\nthough not at all as if they were frightened. \"I\\'m Dickon,\" the boy said. \"I know tha\\'rt Miss Mary.\" Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was\\nDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the\\nnatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and\\nhis smile spread all over his face. \"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha\\' makes a quick move it\\nstartles \\'em. A body \\'as to move gentle an\\' speak low when wild things\\nis about.\" He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but\\nas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she\\nspoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy. \"Did you get Martha\\'s letter?\" she asked. He nodded his curly, rust-colored head. \"That\\'s why I come.\" He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground\\nbeside him when he piped. \"I\\'ve got th\\' garden tools.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read\\nand write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to\\nsix times seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get\\nany further than that if I was to live forever. I don\\'t take no stock\\nin mathematics, anyway. At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got\\nnext day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to\\nschool the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the\\nwidow\\'s ways, too, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me. Living in a house\\nand sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the\\ncold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and\\nso that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting\\nso I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was\\ncoming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she\\nwarn\\'t ashamed of me. One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I\\nreached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of\\nme, and crossed me off. She says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry;\\nwhat a mess you are always making!\" The widow put in a good word for\\nme, but that warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well\\nenough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to\\nbe. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t\\none of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked\\nalong low-spirited and on the watch-out. I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\\nthrough the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\\nground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks. They had come up from the quarry\\nand stood around the stile awhile, and then went on around the garden\\nfence. It was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so. I\\ncouldn\\'t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to\\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I\\ndidn\\'t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in\\nthe left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my\\nshoulder every now and then, but I didn\\'t see nobody. I was at Judge\\nThatcher\\'s as quick as I could get there. He said:\\n\\n\"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.',\n",
       "       'She stood\\nbelow him and called up to him with a sort of gasp. \"Ben Weatherstaff,\\nit was the robin who showed me the way!\" Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of\\nthe wall, he was so outraged. \"Tha\\' young bad \\'un!\" he called down at her. \"Layin\\' tha\\' badness on a\\nrobin--not but what he\\'s impidint enow for anythin\\'. Him showin\\' thee\\nth\\' way! Him! Eh! tha\\' young nowt\"--she could see his next words burst\\nout because he was overpowered by curiosity--\"however i\\' this world did\\ntha\\' get in?\" \"It was the robin who showed me the way,\" she protested obstinately. \"He didn\\'t know he was doing it but he did. And I can\\'t tell you from\\nhere while you\\'re shaking your fist at me.\" He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his\\njaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw\\ncoming over the grass toward him. At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised\\nthat he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But in\\nthe midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to\\nDickon. \"Wheel me over there!\" he commanded. \"Wheel me quite close and stop\\nright in front of him!\" And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which\\nmade his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes\\nwhich came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach\\nbecause a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great\\nblack-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him. And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff\\'s nose. It was really no\\nwonder his mouth dropped open. \"Do you know who I am?\" demanded the Rajah. How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on what\\nwas before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed and\\ngulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word. \"Do you know who\\nI am?\" demanded Colin still more imperiously.',\n",
       "       'If he drank\\nnow and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or\\na pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to\\nlook at a beer-stained pink \"sporting paper,\" with pictures of murderers\\nand half-naked women. It was for such pleasures as these that he spent\\nhis money; and such was his life during the six weeks and a half that he\\ntoiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable them to break the grip of\\ntheir teamsters\\' union. In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of\\nthe laborers. On an average, the tunneling cost a life a day and several\\nmanglings; it was seldom, however, that more than a dozen or two men\\nheard of any one accident. The work was all done by the new boring\\nmachinery, with as little blasting as possible; but there would be\\nfalling rocks and crushed supports, and premature explosions--and in\\naddition all the dangers of railroading. So it was that one night, as\\nJurgis was on his way out with his gang, an engine and a loaded car\\ndashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him\\nupon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete wall and knocking\\nhim senseless. When he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of\\nan ambulance. He was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was\\nthreading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds. They took\\nhim to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he\\nwas washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of\\nmaimed and mangled men. Jurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest\\nChristmas he had had in America. Every year there were scandals and\\ninvestigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that doctors\\nwere allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients; but Jurgis\\nknew nothing of this--his only complaint was that they used to feed him\\nupon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in Packingtown would\\nfeed to his dog. Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned\\ncorned beef and \"roast beef\" of the stockyards; now he began to\\nunderstand--that it was what you might call \"graft meat,\" put up to\\nbe sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and\\nsailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, \"shantymen\" and gangs of\\nrailroad laborers. Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks. This\\ndid not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to\\nwork, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and\\nthat his place was needed for some one worse off than he. That he was\\nutterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the\\nmeantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities,\\nnor any one else in the city. As it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his\\nlast week\\'s board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance of\\nhis Saturday\\'s pay. He had less than seventy-five cents in his pockets,\\nand a dollar and a half due him for the day\\'s work he had done before he\\nwas hurt. He might possibly have sued the company, and got some damages\\nfor his injuries, but he did not know this, and it was not the company\\'s\\nbusiness to tell him. He went and got his pay and his tools, which he\\nleft in a pawnshop for fifty cents. Then he went to his landlady,\\nwho had rented his place and had no other for him; and then to his\\nboardinghouse keeper, who looked him over and questioned him. As he must\\ncertainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded there only\\nsix weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be worth the risk\\nto keep him on trust. So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight. It was\\nbitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his face. He had no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five\\ncents in his pocket, with the certainty that he could not earn another\\ncent for months. The snow meant no chance to him now; he must walk along\\nand see others shoveling, vigorous and active--and he with his left arm\\nbound to his side! He could not hope to tide himself over by odd jobs\\nof loading trucks; he could not even sell newspapers or carry satchels,\\nbecause he was now at the mercy of any rival. Words could not paint the\\nterror that came over him as he realized all this. He was like a wounded\\nanimal in the forest; he was forced to compete with his enemies upon\\nunequal terms. There would be no consideration for him because of his\\nweakness--it was no one\\'s business to help him in such distress, to make\\nthe fight the least bit easier for him. Even if he took to begging, he\\nwould be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he was to discover in good\\ntime.',\n",

       "array(['Hong Kong (CNN)Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong\\'s newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world\\'s second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. The monastery is funded entirely by Asia\\'s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who contributed $193 million from his personal foundation to the building project. The premises, styled on Tang dynasty buildings, sprawl across a lush, green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields. It can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily, but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong\\'s harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect \"important guests.\" \"We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks,\" Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. \"There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks,\" Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online.

       "       '(CNN)If you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this Valentine\\'s Day, it\\'s likely that they came from Kenya. The country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world, accounting for around 35% of all sales in the European Union. Famed for being long-lasting, Kenya\\'s roses, carnations and summer flowers are also popular in Russia and the U.S. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the World Floral Expo in Los Angeles. The event is one of the industry\\'s largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world, with several Ethiopian growers also representing the African continent alongside Kenya. The country\\'s flower power is attributed to its sunny climate, which enables high-quality blossoms to be grown year-round without the need for expensive-to-run greenhouses. Kenya also has excellent transport links to Europe, and from there, the rest of the world through Nairobi airport, which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables. This means that delicate floral cargo which is perishable in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly. More than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the Kenya Flower Council, with roughly half of the country\\'s 127 flower farms concentrated around Lake Naivasha, around 90 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. \"Naivasha is a big center because it\\'s a freshwater lake and it is not very far from Nairobi, which makes transport easy,\" says John Kihia, technical director of Floralife Africa, a company which provides hydration, transport and storage for the cut-flower industry. \"People have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place,\" he adds. Activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake, but local farmers have been working with the WWF in order to make sure that water levels are not affected: \"It\\'s about putting together a strong business case about why it\\'s good for growers to save water and ways to manage that,\" says Drew McVey, WWF technical adviser who calls the collaboration \"a story of success.\" Naivasha Lake\\'s location 1,884 meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium-sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of EU supermarkets, whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in Russia: \"It\\'s a consumer preference. In Moscow people will buy a single rose, so if it\\'s bigger it naturally looks more spectacular, whereas in the UK they buy bunches more often,\" says Kihia. Big business . Horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for Kenya, and the flower industry alone raked in around $600m last year, exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $507m in 2013. Nearly two thirds of exports are destined for Holland, where they are resold to florists through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers: \"If you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product, people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price,\" Kihia says. While Europe remains the biggest destination for Kenyan flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links, this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent, such as the recent recession. \"It has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand, which slows down business,\" says Jane Ngige, CEO of the Kenyan Flower Council. Kenyan exports also suffered when in October of last year the EU imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country, but the levy was lifted on Christmas Day allowing Kenyan producers to storm Valentine\\'s Day sales. Jane Ngige says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as Australia, Canada and Japan, and adds that direct flights from Nairobi airport play a crucial role in helping the Kenyan flower business take off globally: \"A direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality. It also makes it less expensive,\" she says. Kenyan growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring Rwanda by partnering with the country\\'s government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from Rwanda\\'s capital Kigali.

       "       '(CNN)It\\'s a striking image: a new baby cradled in the American flag, held by a Navy sailor whose face we can\\'t see. But is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the American flag? Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. \"I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American,\" Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR.\"That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting.\" Not everyone agreed with Hicks, herself a Navy wife whose husband is deployed. A Facebook page titled \"You call yourself a photographer?\" posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture. The U.S. Flag Code does state that the flag should never be used as \"wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report (PDF). Nor should it be \"used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.\" The threatening private messages, which she has reported to Facebook, saddened her. But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag. Most people posting to the critical Facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture. Wrote one poster, \"I am a veteran and find this picture beautiful. Clearly the military member loves his country and baby.\" \"The photo is making a point,\" another photo fan posted. \"The flag represents our republic, the republic is supporting our future. There is nothing disrespectful about this use of our flag. It is beautiful.\"',\n",

       "       'Lynchburg, Virginia  (CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative firebrand from Texas, became the first Republican to announce his campaign for the presidency, and he spent Monday morning telling a crowd at the largest Christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office, and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign. \"These are all of our stories,\" Cruz told the audience Monday, roaming around the circular stage at Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, opening his remarks by spotlighting his family history and his own path to Washington. \"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\" Cruz drew on the past only to focus on the future, repeatedly and emphatically asking the Liberty University student audience to \"imagine\" the U.S. under conservative leadership -- laying out his vision for the country and a Cruz presidency. The senator from Texas, who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to Obamacare and his willingness to shut down the federal government, presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment Republicans such as Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- candidates Cruz coyly refers to as the \"mushy middle.\" Monday\\'s event was the last part of a carefully coordinated media rollout, following Cruz\\'s announcement of his candidacy in a 30-second video message posted on Twitter shortly after midnight on Monday, roughly 24 hours after the Houston Chronicle first reported his planned announcement. Ten thousand students from Liberty University crowded into the university\\'s main arena for Cruz\\'s announcement. The venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give Cruz an early boost among evangelical voters, who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like Iowa and South Carolina that have early nominating contests. It was a youthful crowd, as students are required to attend the University\\'s tri-weekly convocation address. Not all in the audience were guaranteed Cruz supporters: Several attendees sported red \"Stand with Rand\" shirts, repping Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month. Jerry Falwell Jr., the university\\'s president and son of its founder and evangelical icon, introduced Cruz as a senator who \"has gone against the tide\" and a \"man of great character,\" all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office. Falwell picked up on Cruz\\'s assertion that millions of evangelical Christians did not vote in 2012, pointing out that \"if any candidate can energize that group, it will make a huge difference in any national race.\" Asked after the speech how he prepared for the event, Cruz said he \"spent some time in prayer\" thinking about the message he wants to convey. \"At the end of the day it\\'s listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around,\" Cruz told CNN, adding that he was \"incredibly\" encouraged and inspired by the support. Cruz\\'s announcement came on the five-year anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which Cruz has fought in the Senate to repeal. Cruz marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal \"every word\" of the healthcare law as president. Cruz also jabbed at Common Core education standards -- which Bush supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the IRS, instead suggesting Americans could file their taxes on a postcard. And Cruz drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to \"imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\" Cruz\\'s advisers envision a three-pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the tea party faction and competing in the libertarian and Christian conservative circles. A constant and vocal critic of the Obama administration, Cruz is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against Obamacare in 2013, which led to a tense standoff between Democrats and Republicans and ultimately resulted in a 17-day government shutdown. The showdown was punctuated by Cruz\\'s 21-hour speech on the Senate floor. While popular in conservative and tea party circles, Cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the GOP base, according to public opinion polls. A CNN/ORC International survey conducted this month on the hypothetical Republican primary showed Cruz came in with 4% support among Republicans and independents who lean Republican. But the field is still relatively open, with the top contender -- Bush -- coming in at 16% support, followed by Scott Walker at 13%. But Cruz has relatively strong favorability numbers. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he is viewed in a positive light by 45% of Republicans, compared with only 8% who don\\'t have a favorable opinion of him. Still, 46% say they haven\\'t heard enough about him to form an opinion. Jason Miller, an adviser to Cruz\\'s campaign, confirmed that the campaign\\'s fund-raising target is $40 million, and the campaign believes it can raise $1 million in the first week. Cruz this month finished an early-voting state tour to Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire -- and he\\'s scheduled to return to New Hampshire on March 28 to speak at a brunch in Rockingham County. Depending on the Senate schedule this week, he could possibly make more early-state trips, according to advisers. After his speech Monday, he\\'ll head up to New York for media appearances and a fund-raiser. Cruz developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in Texas as a little-known candidate, forcing then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment Republican. Along with two other first-term senators who are expected to run for president (Rand Paul and Marco Rubio), Cruz will likely face questions over experience, an issue that Republicans brought up in 2008 against Barack Obama, who was also a first-term senator at the time. Before running for the Senate in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- Cruz was solicitor general of Texas and argued before the Supreme Court. He graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Born in Canada to a Cuban father and American mother, Cruz was a dual citizen until he renounced Canadian citizenship in 2014. He faced questions over whether he would qualify for the presidency, though law experts consider him a natural-born citizen because he was born to an American mother. Cruz was swarmed by students and reporters after he descended the stage and started to exit the arena. He took photos and signed autographs for about a half hour, as his team tried to escort him through the crowd. One girl who was raising money selling baked goods offered to give Cruz a dozen cupcakes for free but he pulled out his wallet and gave her $20. A pair of enthusiastic sisters shouted out to Cruz to tell him that, like his own daughters, they were also named Caroline and Catherine and were two years apart. \"That\\'s just cool,\" he said, as he gave them both high fives. \"That is awesome.\" One student who said she was Hispanic said she and her whole family were behind him. \"You have the Hispanic vote,\" she joked, then proceeded to start talking to him Spanish. While Cruz\\'s father is Cuban, he\\'s not fluent in Spanish. \"We grew up speaking Spanglish. My grandmother would be like \\'Nino, throw me the remote control\\',\" he said This is who we are as a people. We got to tell that story,\" Cruz said.

       "       '(CNN)Roberto Mancini says he carries Manchester City\\'s supporters in his heart -- but there\\'s not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the Premier League champions. Manuel Pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current City manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season. Mancini, the man who led Manchester City to its first Premier League title in 44 years back in 2012 says Pellegrini is \"lucky\" to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning England\\'s top division. Pellegrini, who led City to the domestic title last season, is under fire with City trailing Chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the European Champions League. \"I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players,\" Inter Milan coach Mancini told CNN\\'s Don Riddell on the eve of City\\'s crucial game with Barcelona in the Champions League. \"I think City can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year.\" Nicknamed \"the Engineer,\" Pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side\\'s title charge in recent weeks. The Chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its Premier League title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow Burnley last weekend. His team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night. City faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the European Champions League -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season. It must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture. Only once in nine attempts has Barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged Champions League knockout tie and not progressed. Pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at City but a number of those purchases have failed to impress. Eliaquim Mangala, who arrived from Porto for $47million has endured a dismal first season in English football, while $32million man Stevan Jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from Fiorentina. \"It\\'s my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League,\" said Mancini. \"It\\'s in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it\\'s the best team. \"In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute,\" perhaps a nod to City\\'s last gasp English Premier League title win in 2012, thanks to Sergio Aguero\\'s stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers. \"I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title.\" Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes in December 2009, enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure. He led the club to the FA Cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season. Under Mancini, the club attracted star players such as Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Aguero. He signed a new five-year deal with the club in July 2012 but results dipped with rival Manchester United regaining the league title and City suffering a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wigan. Mancini was criticised for his side\\'s lack of success in the Champions League, where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties. The Italian, 50, was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with Carlos Tevez, the Argentina striker, which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the City squad. In the 12 Champions League ties under his stewardship, City managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team\\'s failure on the European stage. At the time of his sacking, the club said that Mancini failed to hit \"stated targets\" and that it wanted to \"develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football\". \"I had a fantastic time in England,\" he added. \"We won the Premier League after many years. I have all City\\'s supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this. \"Maybe I miss the Premier League because I worked there for three-and-a-half years. I built the team that is now in second position. \"I think they play with the same players and I am very proud of this.\" Mancini faces a struggle of his own at Inter with the club unlikely to qualify for European competition next season. Inter is eighth in Serie A and is eight points off the qualifying places for the Europa League. It faces German side Wolfsburg in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday having lost the first leg 3-1.',\n",

       "       '(CNN)It\\'s seen a rapacious Leonardo DiCaprio rip-off the gullible, Sarah Jessica Parker ponder sweet amor and an air-headed Brad Pitt harbor intentions of blackmailing a CIA agent -- all just a bridge away from the madness of Manhattan. In the old times, Brooklyn\\'s historic Navy Yard would be lucky to attract the stars of the silver screen to a USO show. Today, its home to one of the largest film studios outside of Hollywood. The \"Wolf of Wall Street\", \"Sex and the City Two\" and \"Burn After Reading\" are just a few of the major motion pictures shot at Steiner Studios in recent times. More than 40 feature length and TV productions were filmed here in the last year alone. Studio chairman, Doug Steiner, opened the site just over 10 years ago. \"It was really awful looking with wild dogs -- literally wild dogs -- roaming the streets here,\" Steiner said. \"I liked the industrial landscape a lot and the opportunity. To me Brooklyn was a great opportunity waiting to happen because of the proximity to Manhattan.\" At its peak during World War II, the Brooklyn Navy Yard employed some 70,000 people. But the 1.2 square kilometer site fell into steep decline in the 1960s when the sailors moved out. Today, the yard is a vastly different place -- and not just because of the Hollywood A-listers strutting around. A non-profit corporation has been regenerating the location with the aim of creating new employment opportunities since the turn of the century. Steiner studios was one of the first tenants but others have followed. One former warehouse represents the corporation\\'s biggest project to date, with more than 90,000 square meters of space up for grabs and the potential creation of 3,000 new jobs. \"I think our influence on Brooklyn in general has been quite substantial,\" said David Ehrenberg, CEO of the Brooklyn Naval Yard Development Corporation. \"We were the first entity that started investing substantially back into these old buildings on the Brooklyn waterfront. \"And to some extent (we) proved a concept -- that manufacturing and industrial and creative companies would want to take root in Brooklyn,\" Ehrenberg said. Being at the forefront of these wider trends has helped attract a new type of workforce to the area. Steiner says housing prices within half a kilometer have risen up to ten times. Some 1,500 people already work at the studio, which is set on a path of rapid expansion. It is benefiting from the explosion in demand for high quality content across mobile devices - and Steiner sees it as part of a wider trend. \"Old media has always been based in New York City and continues to be based (here), film and television has been anchored in LA and high-tech has always been in northern California,\" Steiner said. \"But I think right now we\\'re seeing everything coming together in New York.\"',\n",

       "       '\\nOn a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was\\nsinging in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan\\ndistances \"above the Forties,\" of a new Opera House which should\\ncompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European\\ncapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every\\nwinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy. Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus\\nkeeping out the \"new people\" whom New York was beginning to dread and\\nyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic\\nassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so\\nproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music. It was Madame Nilsson\\'s first appearance that winter, and what the\\ndaily press had already learned to describe as \"an exceptionally\\nbrilliant audience\" had gathered to hear her, transported through the\\nslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family\\nlandau, or in the humbler but more convenient \"Brown coupe.\" To come to\\nthe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\\nas in one\\'s own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in\\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\\none\\'s own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy. It was\\none of the great livery-stableman\\'s most masterly intuitions to have\\ndiscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more\\nquickly than they want to get to it. When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no reason why\\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\\ncigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.\\nArcher allowed smoking. But, in the first place, New York was a\\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \"not the\\nthing\" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not \"the\\nthing\" played a part as important in Newland Archer\\'s New York as the\\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\\nforefathers thousands of years ago. The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had dawdled\\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\\nrealisation. This was especially the case when the pleasure was a\\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\\ndonna\\'s stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more\\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  \"He loves me--he\\nloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--\" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\\nwith notes as clear as dew. She sang, of course, \"M\\'ama!\" and not \"he loves me,\" since an\\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\\nGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be\\ntranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding of\\nEnglish-speaking audiences. This seemed as natural to Newland Archer\\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole. \"M\\'ama ... non m\\'ama ...\" the prima donna sang, and \"M\\'ama! \", with a\\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\\nthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\\nvictim. Newland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\\nhouse. Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott,\\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\\nattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\\nby some of the younger members of the family. On this occasion, the\\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott, and her daughter, Mrs. Welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\\nfixed on the stagelovers. As Madame Nilsson\\'s \"M\\'ama!\" thrilled out\\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\\nDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl\\'s cheek, mantled her brow\\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\\nsingle gardenia. She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw her\\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly. He drew a breath of\\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage. No expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\\nOpera houses of Paris and Vienna. The foreground, to the footlights,\\nwas covered with emerald green cloth. In the middle distance\\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\\nand red roses. Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank\\'s far-off\\nprodigies. In the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white\\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul\\'s\\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\\nthe right wing. \"The darling!\"',\n",
       "       'But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.\\nJackson\\'s breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\\nwhat he wanted to know. The club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts\\'s opera-glass. For a moment he\\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\\ntwist, and said simply:  \"I didn\\'t think the Mingotts would have tried\\nit on.\" Newland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a\\nstrange state of embarrassment. It was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided\\nattention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothed\\nwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not\\nidentify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presence\\ncreated such excitement among the initiated. Then light dawned on him,\\nand with it came a momentary rush of indignation. No, indeed; no one\\nwould have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on! But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind\\nhim left no doubt in Archer\\'s mind that the young woman was May\\nWelland\\'s cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as \"poor\\nEllen Olenska.\" Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe\\na day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not\\ndisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying\\nwith old Mrs. Mingott. Archer entirely approved of family solidarity,\\nand one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their\\nresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock\\nhad produced. There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man\\'s\\nheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by\\nfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but\\nto receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing\\nfrom producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the\\nvery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer,\\nwas to be announced within a few weeks. No, he felt as old Sillerton\\nJackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on! He knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenue\\'s\\nlimits) that old Mrs. Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, would\\ndare. He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in\\nspite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with a\\nfather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough\\nto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the\\nwealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to \"foreigners\" (an\\nItalian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch to\\nher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone\\n(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in\\nthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park. Old Mrs. Mingott\\'s foreign daughters had become a legend. They never\\ncame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons\\nof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her\\nhabit, had philosophically remained at home. But the cream-coloured\\nhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisian\\naristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she\\nthroned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the\\nTuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as\\nplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above\\nThirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened like\\ndoors instead of sashes that pushed up. Every one (including Mr. Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that old\\nCatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York,\\njustified every success, and excused a certain number of failings. Unkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won her\\nway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of\\nhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency\\nand dignity of her private life. Mr. Manson Mingott had died when she\\nwas only twenty-eight, and had \"tied up\" the money with an additional\\ncaution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold young\\nwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,\\nmarried her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable\\ncircles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarly\\nwith Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend of\\nMme. Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first to\\nproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only\\nrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier\\nCatherine. Mrs. Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband\\'s\\nfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of\\nher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when\\nshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it\\nshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the\\ntransient pleasures of the table. Therefore, for totally different\\nreasons, her food was as poor as Mrs. Archer\\'s, and her wines did\\nnothing to redeem it. Her relatives considered that the penury of her\\ntable discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associated\\nwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the\\n\"made dishes\" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of\\nher son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the\\nbest chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  \"What\\'s the use of\\ntwo good cooks in one family, now that I\\'ve married the girls and can\\'t\\neat sauces?\" Newland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his\\neyes toward the Mingott box. He saw that Mrs. Welland and her\\nsister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the\\nMingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,\\nand that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due\\nto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of\\nthe situation. As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully\\nin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,\\nas she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New York\\nwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for\\nwishing to pass unnoticed. Few things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against\\n\"Taste,\" that far-off divinity of whom \"Form\" was the mere visible\\nrepresentative and vicegerent. Madame Olenska\\'s pale and serious face\\nappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy\\nsituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from\\nher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him. He hated to think of May\\nWelland\\'s being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless\\nof the dictates of Taste.',\n",
       "       'The bell at the inner\\ndoor in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling, she is\\nadmonished by Mrs. Snagsby, on pain of instant reconsignment to her\\npatron saint, not to omit the ceremony of announcement. Much\\ndiscomposed in her nerves (which were previously in the best order)\\nby this threat, she so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to\\nannounce \"Mr. and Mrs. Cheeseming, least which, Imeantersay,\\nwhatsername!\" and retires conscience-stricken from the presence. Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general\\nappearance of having a good deal of train oil in his system. Mrs.\\nChadband is a stern, severe-looking, silent woman. Mr. Chadband moves\\nsoftly and cumbrously, not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk\\nupright. He is very much embarrassed about the arms, as if they were\\ninconvenient to him and he wanted to grovel, is very much in a\\nperspiration about the head, and never speaks without first putting\\nup his great hand, as delivering a token to his hearers that he is\\ngoing to edify them. \"My friends,\" says Mr. Chadband, \"peace be on this house! On the\\nmaster thereof, on the mistress thereof, on the young maidens, and on\\nthe young men! My friends, why do I wish for peace? What is peace? Is\\nit war? No. Is it strife? No. Is it lovely, and gentle, and\\nbeautiful, and pleasant, and serene, and joyful? Oh, yes! Therefore,\\nmy friends, I wish for peace, upon you and upon yours.\" In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified, Mr. Snagsby\\nthinks it expedient on the whole to say amen, which is well received. \"Now, my friends,\" proceeds Mr. Chadband, \"since I am upon this\\ntheme--\"\\n\\nGuster presents herself. Mrs. Snagsby, in a spectral bass voice and\\nwithout removing her eyes from Chadband, says with dreadful\\ndistinctness, \"Go away!\" \"Now, my friends,\" says Chadband, \"since I am upon this theme, and in\\nmy lowly path improving it--\"\\n\\nGuster is heard unaccountably to murmur \"one thousing seven hundred\\nand eighty-two.\" The spectral voice repeats more solemnly, \"Go away!\" \"Now, my friends,\" says Mr. Chadband, \"we will inquire in a spirit of\\nlove--\"\\n\\nStill Guster reiterates \"one thousing seven hundred and eighty-two.\" Mr. Chadband, pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be\\npersecuted and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile,\\nsays, \"Let us hear the maiden! Speak, maiden!\" \"One thousing seven hundred and eighty-two, if you please, sir. Which\\nhe wish to know what the shilling ware for,\" says Guster, breathless. \"For?\" returns Mrs. Chadband.',\n",
       "       'I used\\nalways to be tired. When I dig I\\'m not tired at all. I like to smell\\nthe earth when it\\'s turned up.\" \"It\\'s rare good for thee,\" he said, nodding his head wisely. \"There\\'s\\nnaught as nice as th\\' smell o\\' good clean earth, except th\\' smell o\\'\\nfresh growin\\' things when th\\' rain falls on \\'em. I get out on th\\' moor\\nmany a day when it\\'s rainin\\' an\\' I lie under a bush an\\' listen to th\\'\\nsoft swish o\\' drops on th\\' heather an\\' I just sniff an\\' sniff. My nose\\nend fair quivers like a rabbit\\'s, mother says.\" \"Do you never catch cold?\" inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly. She had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one. \"Not me,\" he said, grinning. \"I never ketched cold since I was born. I wasn\\'t brought up nesh enough. I\\'ve chased about th\\' moor in all\\nweathers same as th\\' rabbits does. Mother says I\\'ve sniffed up too\\nmuch fresh air for twelve year\\' to ever get to sniffin\\' with cold.

       "       'I never see pap when he didn\\'t want the chicken himself, but\\nthat is what he used to say, anyway. Mornings before daylight I slipped into corn-fields and borrowed a\\nwatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things\\nof that kind. Pap always said it warn\\'t no harm to borrow things if\\nyou was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it\\nwarn\\'t anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would\\ndo it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was\\npartly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three\\nthings from the list and say we wouldn\\'t borrow them any more--then he\\nreckoned it wouldn\\'t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it\\nover all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up\\nour minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the\\nmushmelons, or what. But toward daylight we got it all settled\\nsatisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p\\'simmons. We\\nwarn\\'t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain\\'t ever\\ngood, and the p\\'simmons wouldn\\'t be ripe for two or three months yet. We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\\nor didn\\'t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\\nlived pretty high. The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight,\\nwith a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a\\nsolid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of\\nitself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight\\nriver ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I,\\n\"Hel-_lo_, Jim, looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed\\nherself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The\\nlightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of\\nher upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy\\nclean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat\\nhanging on the back of it, when the flashes come. Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so\\nmysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would \\'a\\' felt when\\nI seen that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle\\nof the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little,\\nand see what there was there. So I says:\\n\\n\"Le\\'s land on her, Jim.\" But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\\n\\n\"I doan\\' want to go fool\\'n\\' \\'long er no wrack. We\\'s doin\\' blame\\' well,\\nen we better let blame\\' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not\\ndey\\'s a watchman on dat wrack.\" \"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain\\'t nothing to watch but\\nthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\\'s going to\\nresk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\\nit\\'s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" Jim\\ncouldn\\'t say nothing to that, so he didn\\'t try. \"And besides,\" I says,\\n\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain\\'s\\nstateroom. Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and\\n_they_ don\\'t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they\\nwant it.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nThe news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the\\npeople tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them\\nputting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle\\nof a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would\\nsay, over a fence:\\n\\n\"Is it _them?_\"\\n\\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\\n\\n\"You bet it is.\" When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\\nthree girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but\\nthat don\\'t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her\\nface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her\\nuncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped\\nfor them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they _had_\\nit! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet\\nagain at last and have such good times. Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then\\nhe looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs;\\nso then him and the duke, with a hand across each other\\'s shoulder,\\nand t\\'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there,\\neverybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise\\nstopping, people saying \"\\'Sh!\" and all the men taking their hats off\\nand drooping their heads, so you could \\'a\\' heard a pin fall. And when\\nthey got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one\\nsight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could \\'a\\' heard them to\\nOrleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\\'s necks,\\nand hung their chins over each other\\'s shoulders; and then for three\\nminutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that\\ndamp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of\\nthe coffin, and t\\'other on t\\'other side, and they kneeled down and\\nrested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to\\nthemselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you\\nnever see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to\\nsobbing right out loud--the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly,\\nwent up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn,\\non the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up\\ntowards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and\\nwent off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never\\nsee anything so disgusting. Well, by and by the king he gets up and\\ncomes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a\\nspeech, all full of tears and flapdoodle, about its being a sore trial\\nfor him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing\\ndiseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it\\'s\\na trial that\\'s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy\\nand these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out\\nof his brother\\'s heart, because out of their mouths they can\\'t, words\\nbeing too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it\\nwas just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen,\\nand turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust. And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the\\ncrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their\\nmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church\\nletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and\\nhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and\\nbully. Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\\nnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the\\nfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up\\nwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying\\nyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that\\nwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he\\nwill name the same, to wit, as follows, viz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and\\nDeacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi\\nBell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley. Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\\ntogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to\\nt\\'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was\\naway up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so\\nthey all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked\\nto him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn\\'t say\\nnothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel\\nof sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said\\n\"Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo\" all the time, like a baby that can\\'t talk. So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty\\nmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts\\nof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to\\nGeorge\\'s family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote\\nhim the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them\\nout of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat. Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the\\nking he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house\\nand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the\\ntanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other\\nhouses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand\\ndollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand\\ncash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said they\\'d go and fetch\\nit up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come\\nwith a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found\\nthe bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all\\nthem yaller-boys. My, the way the king\\'s eyes did shine!',\n",
       "       'Mrs. Skimpole sighed, I thought, as if she would have been glad to\\nstrike out this item in the family attainments. I also thought that\\nshe rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took\\nevery opportunity of throwing in another. \"It is pleasant,\" said Mr. Skimpole, turning his sprightly eyes from\\none to the other of us, \"and it is whimsically interesting to trace\\npeculiarities in families. In this family we are all children, and I\\nam the youngest.\" The daughters, who appeared to be very fond of him, were amused by\\nthis droll fact, particularly the Comedy daughter. \"My dears, it is true,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"is it not? So it is, and\\nso it must be, because like the dogs in the hymn, \\'it is our nature\\nto.\\' Now, here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity\\nand a knowledge of details perfectly surprising. It will sound very\\nstrange in Miss Summerson\\'s ears, I dare say, that we know nothing\\nabout chops in this house. But we don\\'t, not the least. We can\\'t cook\\nanything whatever. A needle and thread we don\\'t know how to use. We\\nadmire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want, but we\\ndon\\'t quarrel with them. Then why should they quarrel with us? Live\\nand let live, we say to them. Live upon your practical wisdom, and\\nlet us live upon you!\" He laughed, but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what\\nhe said. \"We have sympathy, my roses,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"sympathy for\\neverything. Have we not?\" \"Oh, yes, papa!\" cried the three daughters. \"In fact, that is our family department,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"in this\\nhurly-burly of life. We are capable of looking on and of being\\ninterested, and we DO look on, and we ARE interested. What more can\\nwe do? Here is my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I\\ndare say her marrying another child, and having two more, was all\\nwrong in point of political economy, but it was very agreeable. We\\nhad our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social\\nideas. She brought her young husband home one day, and they and their\\nyoung fledglings have their nest upstairs. I dare say at some time or\\nother Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have\\nTHEIR nests upstairs too. So we get on, we don\\'t know how, but\\nsomehow.\"',\n",
       "       '\\nBut they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came\\nsome very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which\\ntwo things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him\\ninto a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning\\nto do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes,\\nto talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and\\nhedges and on the borders of streams. The things he had to tell about\\notters\\' and badgers\\' and water-rats\\' houses, not to mention birds\\'\\nnests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost\\ntremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an\\nanimal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety\\nthe whole busy underworld was working. \"They\\'re same as us,\" said Dickon, \"only they have to build their homes\\nevery year. An\\' it keeps \\'em so busy they fair scuffle to get \\'em\\ndone.\" The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made\\nbefore Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the\\ngarden. No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after\\nthey turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk\\noutside the ivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and\\nmore fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was\\none of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever\\nsuspect that they had a secret. People must think that he was simply\\ngoing out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object\\nto their looking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks\\nabout their route. They would go up this path and down that one and\\ncross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they\\nwere looking at the \"bedding-out plants\" the head gardener, Mr. Roach,\\nhad been having arranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do\\nthat no one would think it at all mysterious. They would turn into the\\nshrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of\\nmarch made by great generals in time of war. Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the\\ninvalid\\'s apartments had of course filtered through the servants\\' hall\\ninto the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding\\nthis, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from\\nMaster Colin\\'s room to the effect that he must report himself in the\\napartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to\\nspeak to him. \"Well, well,\" he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,\\n\"what\\'s to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn\\'t to be looked at\\ncalling up a man he\\'s never set eyes on.\" Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a\\nglimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his\\nuncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard\\noftenest was that he might die at any moment and there had been\\nnumerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs,\\ngiven by people who had never seen him. \"Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,\" said Mrs. Medlock, as\\nshe led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened\\nthe hitherto mysterious chamber. \"Let\\'s hope they\\'re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,\" he answered. \"They couldn\\'t well change for the worse,\" she continued; \"and queer as\\nit all is there\\'s them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand\\nup under. Don\\'t you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in\\nthe middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby\\'s Dickon more at home than\\nyou or me could ever be.\" There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately\\nbelieved. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently. \"He\\'d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,\"\\nhe said. \"And yet it\\'s not impudence, either. He\\'s just fine, is that\\nlad.\"',\n",
       "       'I felt that\\nno one--mother, sister, wife--could honour him more than I. I did,\\nindeed! My poor little visitor made me a present of the account, and when as\\nthe evening began to close in she rose to take her leave, lest she\\nshould miss the coach by which she was to return, she was still full\\nof the shipwreck, which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to\\nunderstand in all its details. \"My dear,\" said she as she carefully folded up her scarf and gloves,\\n\"my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon him. And no\\ndoubt he will. You are of that opinion?\" That he well deserved one, yes. That he would ever have one, no. \"Why not, Fitz Jarndyce?\" she asked rather sharply. I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men\\ndistinguished by peaceful services, however good and great, unless\\noccasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very\\nlarge amount of money. \"Why, good gracious,\" said Miss Flite, \"how can you say that? Surely\\nyou know, my dear, that all the greatest ornaments of England in\\nknowledge, imagination, active humanity, and improvement of every\\nsort are added to its nobility! Look round you, my dear, and\\nconsider. YOU must be rambling a little now, I think, if you don\\'t\\nknow that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the\\nland!\" I am afraid she believed what she said, for there were moments when\\nshe was very mad indeed. And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to\\nkeep. I had thought, sometimes, that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that\\nif he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me\\nbefore he went away. I had thought, sometimes, that if he had done\\nso, I should have been glad of it. But how much better it was now\\nthat this had never happened! What should I have suffered if I had\\nhad to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as\\nmine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his\\nbondage to one whom he had never seen!

       "       \"this is an ongoing fuck up, stared around 3 months ago, and i am still suffering the consequences of it. this probably won't be a funny story, as i just mean to vent a bit.\\n\\nit all started with my girlfriend and i looking for a job in germany. we met each other working in switzerland, i'm from holland and she is from slovakia, so we always speak german together. getting a job in a country where they speak german made the most sense. while looking for a job we were living in a small temporary flat in holland. at first the job search didn't go too well, its somewhat hard to find a job for two people at the same restaurant and/or hotel, especially if these two people are in love, employers dont seem to like that. but i really needed to find a job fast since i was in a little bit of debt with my health insurance company and still needed to pay back my student loans from years back. after two weeks of fruitless job searching i get a call from a friend, that tells us there is a small lunchroom in the town we live in that is looking to rent out. this lunchroom was furnished, and it had all the necessary machines and kitchenware to get it up and running. it would be perfect to run with just the two of us, since its a small place. they also asked a really low amount of rent, it seemed perfect, almost too perfect. we considered doing it for a couple of days, but we could never be sure what our income was going to be, since we would be the one's to get the lunchroom up and running from scratch. if we have had some money to spend we would have taken the risk right away, because who wouldn't want their own little restaurant? luckily more good news wasn't far off, and we were offered two positions as waiters in a big 4 star hotel in a beautiful area in south germany.\\n\\nall of the communication with this hotel was per email, and everything went extremely fast, almost a bit too fast. in less than 24 hours after telling the hotel we were going to come, they sent us our contracts, and wanted us to sign them and send them back asap. we glanced through it, all seemed fine, signed it, and sent it back. fast forward a week and we are in south germany working our first shift. immediately we find out why they were so eager for us, there were far to few staff members, the boss didn't seem very pleasant and the housing they provided us was not at all what we were promised. after talking to a few of the employees that were already working there we found out that it would be wise not to stay there long. we made allot of hours, and overtime work would not be payed. our room was old, the shared bathroom, (eleven people) was dirty and the food they served for the employees was not very nutritious. we were promised a 5 day work week, little to no overtime work, and an all new renovated employees house. we didn't even get to keep our tips, it was divided over all of the staff, (which is normal in a lot of hotels, but our co-workers told us that is was a very small amount of money, it didn't add up at all.) after a week of hard work because of a lack of co-workers, we had enough, and decided to go back to holland and try and run this lunchroom, since we were tired of looking for jobs. going to germany probably was fuck up number #1, since it almost cost me all the money i had left traveling there. in hindsight we should have just sucked it up, and kept working until i had my debts payed. but our ignorance told us we would be making some good money running our own little bistro, and since we both used to work in the restaurant business allot, what could go wrong?\\n\\nenough backstory, up to fuck up number #2. once back in holland, we signed a lease contract, and we were told we could do with the place whatever we wanted, only condition was that it had to be all organic food and drinks since it was next too an organic food store. all good, no problem, my girlfriend and i both want to eat healthy, this is a perfect way to do this. we start our preparations, making a menu, making a list of all the products we need, researching for popular and healthy drinks like smoothies, slow juices and freshly pressed wheat grass juice etc. we buy some things we use to make the place look nice, nothing too expensive, some plants, a few cheap paintings for on the wall and all that stuff. we use our last money to print out flyers and put up a small add in the local newspaper. we had a good feeling, and our first day confirmed that feeling. allot of people came by to check out the new place in town, we had a good day, and were very happy things seemed to work out for the better! unfortunately it did not last, and we soon found out it was just the hype of the openings day that drew people to us. since then it has been very quiet in our little bistro, some random people drop by once every full moon, far to little to make a living for 1 person, let alone 2. in the meantime, my debts are not getting paid, and we are stuck with the bistro for a couple more months. looking for a new job as we speak, we have given up trying to make our lunchroom run after allot of failed attempts at trying to get people to come. from handing out free samples of what we sell in the main street to handing out flyers and coming up with awesome offers, it was all in vain. we were located just outside the main street, the street that literally everybody goes too to do their shopping and dining. we underestimated this, and thought we could get the people to abandon their daily routines in this small town and come to us. it did not work. i'm pretty much stressing out, and needed to vent some of this. not sure what to do next, but i guess one way or another we will have to find out. thanks for reading my fuck up, and sticking with it till the end, even that means allot.\",\n",

       "       'as is tradition, this incident happened back in the summer of 2009...\\n\\ni had just gotten out of the hospital in los angeles after being admitted for three days due to a bad flare up of my ulcerative colitis. i decided to visit my family in my hometown in central texas, so i booked an amtrak sleeper room that was traveling from la to san antonio, with my final destination being mcgregor, tx, which is about 20 minutes west of waco (yes, the two places recently known for magnolia realty from the popular show fixer upper, though that\\'s not at all relevant.) the trip basically takes 3 days, but it\\'s a great way to travel and decently priced, and i found the sleeper car to be very comfortable, especially with a laptop to watch movies. however, i would only get to enjoy one night on the train...\\n\\nso we depart los angeles at around noon, and the first stop was at a tiny train depot in palm springs. it was literally just a slab of concrete with a single bathroom. as the train stops at the tiny concrete outhouse in the late afternoon, we are informed that there will be a 5 minute break for smokers. well, i didn\\'t smoke cigarettes at the time, but i had just been released from the hospital a day earlier and i also had a medical marijuana card/rec for my uc (which absolutely helped me deal with the various issues caused by my chronic illness.) so, needing some relief for long ride, i decided to step off the train and smoke a little bit of green in the bathroom of the \\'depot\\'. unfortunately, whoever was using the restroom was taking forever, so when i realized it had been almost 5 minutes of waiting, i knew i wasn\\'t going to be able to succeed in my mission, so i turned around to walk back to the train...only to find out i had been given a new mission...as i witnessed the train slowly pulling away from the depot (with all of my bags and my laptop stored in my room on board.... i immediately tried to wave down the train, as if it was going to stop and let me back on haha. i almost had a mental breakdown in front of 5 people at the tiny depot. as fate would have it, a taxi had just pulled up to take someone to the palm springs airport. i had my phone, wallet, and pipe full of marijuhwahna in my pockets, so i asked the taxi driver if he could take me to the airport to try to rent a car. he graciously accepted and didn\\'t throw a little fit when i told him that all i had was a credit card instead of cash, which many cab drivers have done previously. i think he was more amazed/amused with my predicament.\\n\\nso i arrive at the airport and head to the only rental car kiosk that rents cars to 21 year olds (i had turned 21 six months earlier and many places only rent to people who are at least 25 years old.) i rented a nice compact ford focus, set the gps for el paso, and with hope in my heart i set out on my ~10 hour drive through the night. i still had my bowl of chronic, so a few hours into the drive i smoked, then stopped at a walmart to buy a cd for the rest of the drive (echoes: the best of pink floyd, because hell yeah!), as well as a dvd for when i eventually got back to my laptop (gangs of new york, because....well, because it\\'s awesome.) \\n\\nafter 10 hours of basically non-stop driving through the night and wee hours of the morning, i arrived in el paso about an hour before the train did, dropped off the rental car, took a taxi to the train station, had my ticket reprinted, and then patiently waited for a train to arrive... (while thinking of a dream i had-- sort of relevant lyrics to a great walkmen song.) once it did, i went to the train attendant who was checking tickets and told him about my epic fuck-up and why i was boarding with an la to mcgregor ticket. he looked at the ticket, looked at me with a stunned look on his face, and then said \"...man, get on the train and get some damn sleep!\" i got to my little room to find that my stuff had been exactly as i left it. before i went to sleep, i went to the dining car and had myself a delicious breakfast of eggs benedict-- an apropos meal for the betrayal of my own responsibility. i went to sleep and woke up many hours later once we arrived in san antonio at night. had dinner alone at a mediocre chain tex-mex restaurant on the river walk (in 100 degree heat with 99.999% humidity), watched gangs of new york in my room, and then went back to sleep until we arrived in austin in the morning, on the third day of the trip, before finally heading to my final destination of mcgregor. luckily, everything had gone according to the plan that was born of everything not going to the plan. \\n\\nneedless to say, it was one of the biggest screwups of my short life, but it\\'s also a hilarious story of idiocy, which i sometimes tell to new friends and strangers alike. i once told it to a customer from palm springs over the phone when i worked tech support, and he said he knew the exact train depot i got left at and began laughing while he told his buddy in the background all about the incident. glad it could still bring joy to random people years later haha. moral of the story: pay attention when getting off a train to smoke, and keep your eye on it no matter what... as if that needs to be mentioned anyway. i still loved the train ride though and highly recommend it! cheers.'],\n",

       "array(['Hong Kong (CNN)Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong\\'s newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world\\'s second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. The monastery is funded entirely by Asia\\'s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who contributed $193 million from his personal foundation to the building project. The premises, styled on Tang dynasty buildings, sprawl across a lush, green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields. It can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily, but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong\\'s harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect \"important guests.\" \"We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks,\" Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. \"There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks,\" Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online.

       "       '(CNN)A group of medical students -- including an American, seven Britons and a Canadian -- may be the latest Westerners to join ISIS. It\\'s become a familiar story: Young people give up their futures in Western democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self-declared Islamic state in the Middle East. Last month, three teenage British girls suspected of wanting to join ISIS may have gone to Syria, authorities said. Their fates remain unknown. An estimated 3,400 Westerners have gone to join ISIS in its bloody quest to establish an Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, said Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Analysts and U.S. officials agree: ISIS is skilled at luring Westerners, attracting far greater numbers than al Qaeda.  How is it doing this? ISIS recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. \"The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,\" counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett wrote last year in a report called \"Foreign fighters in Syria.\" Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East studies at The London School of Economics, put it more bluntly: . \"ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip.\" Many recruits come from educated, well-to-do backgrounds, like 25-year-old Abu Anwar of Britain. He said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join ISIS. \"I\\'m from the south of England. I grew up in a middle-class family,\" he told CNN. \"Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is, you cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape.\" The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife. Others may succumb to more tangible promises. ISIS loyalists are told they will receive gifts from Allah, wrote Aqsa Mahmood, a young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS and now is an ISIS recruiter. Such gifts include \"a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,\" Mahmood wrote. ISIS\\' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hourlong video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ISIS now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \"It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following,\" he said. Even the U.S. State Department admits ISIS\\' propaganda prowess \"is something we have not seen before.\" \"It\\'s something we need to do a lot more work on,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last month. \"We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we\\'re combating.\" \"We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,\" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of \"Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,\" told CNN last year.  \"... It is very attractive for angry young Muslims when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them.\" The slick strategy offers a big edge over al Qaeda.  ISIS \"has proven far more adept than core al Qaeda -- or any of al Qaeda\\'s affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience,\" Rasmussen said. Recruits are also being lured by ISIS\\' success in its endeavor to create an Islamic state, analysts say. The intelligence community determined that ISIS\\' battlefield successes gave it \"some recruitment success,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in September. \"Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting,\" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. \"This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield,\" said Steve Hassan,  founder of Freedom of Mind, a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. \"But in fact, it\\'s a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers.\" That type of brainwashing is what turned Canadian Damian Clairmont into an ISIS militant, said his mother, Christianne Boudreau. \"It\\'s so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\" she said. Clairmont died fighting in Syria last year. While ISIS\\' recruiting success gets a lot of attention, it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young Westerners. About 130 Canadian citizens have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, Canada\\'s intelligence agency estimated last year. About 1,200 French fighters have joined ISIS as well.  Roughly 600 British nationals are believed to have gone to Iraq and Syria, according to research groups, along with another 600 from Germany. In the United States, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. But it\\'s unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Once foreigners go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS, their odds of going back to their families can be slim. Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. Western leaders acknowledge there\\'s work to do. \"It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said last year. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants\\' messaging. \"We\\'re seeing their approaches continue to evolve,\" Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told CNN. \"We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we\\'re combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource.\" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. \"We\\'re really going to pick it up now,\" Psaki said. \"We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months.\" Several anti-ISIS efforts are already in place. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, said Barrett, the counterterrorism expert. And U.S. State Department official Richard Stengel said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining. \"They\\'re reading the messages, they\\'re hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing,\" Stengel said in October. But Barrett said some officials might not be doing as much as they think. \"Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own.\" CNN\\'s Josh Levs, Joshua Berlinger, Paula Newton, Jethro Mullen, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo, Laura Koran and Elise Labott contributed to this report.',\n",
       "       '(CNN)If you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this Valentine\\'s Day, it\\'s likely that they came from Kenya. The country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world, accounting for around 35% of all sales in the European Union. Famed for being long-lasting, Kenya\\'s roses, carnations and summer flowers are also popular in Russia and the U.S. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the World Floral Expo in Los Angeles. The event is one of the industry\\'s largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world, with several Ethiopian growers also representing the African continent alongside Kenya. The country\\'s flower power is attributed to its sunny climate, which enables high-quality blossoms to be grown year-round without the need for expensive-to-run greenhouses. Kenya also has excellent transport links to Europe, and from there, the rest of the world through Nairobi airport, which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables. This means that delicate floral cargo which is perishable in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly. More than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the Kenya Flower Council, with roughly half of the country\\'s 127 flower farms concentrated around Lake Naivasha, around 90 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. \"Naivasha is a big center because it\\'s a freshwater lake and it is not very far from Nairobi, which makes transport easy,\" says John Kihia, technical director of Floralife Africa, a company which provides hydration, transport and storage for the cut-flower industry. \"People have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place,\" he adds. Activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake, but local farmers have been working with the WWF in order to make sure that water levels are not affected: \"It\\'s about putting together a strong business case about why it\\'s good for growers to save water and ways to manage that,\" says Drew McVey, WWF technical adviser who calls the collaboration \"a story of success.\" Naivasha Lake\\'s location 1,884 meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium-sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of EU supermarkets, whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in Russia: \"It\\'s a consumer preference. In Moscow people will buy a single rose, so if it\\'s bigger it naturally looks more spectacular, whereas in the UK they buy bunches more often,\" says Kihia. Big business . Horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for Kenya, and the flower industry alone raked in around $600m last year, exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $507m in 2013. Nearly two thirds of exports are destined for Holland, where they are resold to florists through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers: \"If you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product, people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price,\" Kihia says. While Europe remains the biggest destination for Kenyan flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links, this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent, such as the recent recession. \"It has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand, which slows down business,\" says Jane Ngige, CEO of the Kenyan Flower Council. Kenyan exports also suffered when in October of last year the EU imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country, but the levy was lifted on Christmas Day allowing Kenyan producers to storm Valentine\\'s Day sales. Jane Ngige says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as Australia, Canada and Japan, and adds that direct flights from Nairobi airport play a crucial role in helping the Kenyan flower business take off globally: \"A direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality. It also makes it less expensive,\" she says. Kenyan growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring Rwanda by partnering with the country\\'s government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from Rwanda\\'s capital Kigali. It\\'s hoped that the park will eventually produce three million stems per year and kick-start Rwanda\\'s floriculture sector, which could pump more than $200 million into the country\\'s economy by 2017.

       "       '(CNN)A Pennsylvania State University fraternity has been suspended after allegedly posting on a private Facebook page compromising photos of women, including some who appeared to be asleep or passed out.

In a statement, college administrators said the fraternity\\'s local chapter had been suspended for one year by the Penn State Interfraternity Council and that police and university officials were investigating. The statement said the fraternity used the private Facebook page to post \"highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at Penn State.\" The images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose, others appeared incapacitated. \"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the University community\\'s values and expectations,\" the statement said. Penn State University President Eric Barron said in a separate statement Wednesday that the university will work with Kappa Delta Rho\\'s national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated. The university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at Penn State, Barron said. \"It ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a re-evaluation of the fraternity system is required,\" he said. \"Some members of the University senior leadership believe it is, and we are considering our options.\" David Clohessy, director of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university\\'s handling of sex crime reports. \"For years now, Penn State enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who\\'d listen that the university\\'s problematic culture about sex crimes had been \\'reformed,\" Clohessy said. \"The latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on Facebook, some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims.\" In 2012, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a  30- to 60-year prison term. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is appealing. \"The Kappa Delta Rho is a wake-up call,\" Clohessy said. \"But the Sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too.\" A former member of Kappa Delta Rho alerted police to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of \"unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing,\" according to a copy of a police affidavit. The drugs allegedly included \"marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication, and some cocaine,\" the affidavit said. The former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second Facebook page called \"2.0\" allegedly had been created around April 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it, the affidavit said. The earlier version of the page was titled \"Covert Business Transactions.\" Rape, nude photos, racist behavior: Do fraternities make men behave badly? The ex-frat member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, the affidavit said. The affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges, including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used. In the Sandusky case, the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by Sandusky -- either groped in a car, soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed. The scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and Penn State\\'s vaunted football program, including the dismissal of the late legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America\\'s highest-paid university presidents, Graham Spanier. It also tarnished Penn State\\'s celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics. \"We hope that Penn State officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students,\" said Clohessy, whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations. Attempts to reach the university and interfraternity council were unsuccessful. CNN\\'s Laura Ly and Sara Ganim contributed to this report.',\n",
       "       '(CNN)It\\'s a striking image: a new baby cradled in the American flag, held by a Navy sailor whose face we can\\'t see. But is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the American flag? Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. \"I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American,\" Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR.\"That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting.\" Not everyone agreed with Hicks, herself a Navy wife whose husband is deployed. A Facebook page titled \"You call yourself a photographer?\" posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture. The U.S. Flag Code does state that the flag should never be used as \"wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report (PDF). Nor should it be \"used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.\" The threatening private messages, which she has reported to Facebook, saddened her. But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag. Most people posting to the critical Facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture. Wrote one poster, \"I am a veteran and find this picture beautiful. Clearly the military member loves his country and baby.\" \"The photo is making a point,\" another photo fan posted. \"The flag represents our republic, the republic is supporting our future. There is nothing disrespectful about this use of our flag. It is beautiful.\"',\n",

The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated \"our jihadi brothers\" there.

       "       '(CNN)When it comes to the U.S. fraternity and sorority system, it\\'s a disturbing truth: Life is largely segregated by race, money and power; and, yet, most of us find that unsurprising. This week, however, we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change. The push came in the form of a nine-second YouTube video, which I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen by now. It reportedly shows members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting these chilling lines: \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" \"The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant,\" CNN\\'s Eliott C. McLaughlin writes, describing a clip that rocketed around social media, leading OU\\'s president, David Boren, to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school. The video is hard to watch, but I have a feeling it\\'s one we need to see, both because it hints at the inner workings of certain Greek organizations, and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the United States. I\\'m thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public. That alone should give some reason for hope. Others weren\\'t, but I was shocked by the video. This, in 2015? In my home state? Both of my parents participated in Greek life in Oklahoma, but at a different university. I know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement. What happened on the bus at OU doesn\\'t negate their positive experiences. But it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion. Sometimes students are excluded from Greek life, in theory, because they\\'re seen as uncool or don\\'t \"fit in\" with a particular chapter. But we\\'d be kidding ourselves if we didn\\'t realize that, often, a person\\'s race -- or sexual orientation, for that matter --  factors into this you\\'re-in, you\\'re-out process. Oklahoma school\\'s response to video caught between racism, Civil Rights Act . And it\\'s hard for me not to see the SAE video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology. This is a case of dangerous group-think run amok. In a system that remains largely divided by race, perhaps videos like this shouldn\\'t be so surprising. That\\'s the view of Matthew Hughey, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who studies racial dynamics in American Greek life. The U.S. fraternity and sorority system is \"a form of American apartheid,\" he told me in an interview on Monday. Instead of thinking of the Oklahoma fraternity members as \"bad apples,\" he said, we should see them as part of a \"bad orchard.\" That orchard includes, but isn\\'t limited to, Greek organizations, he told me. It also includes the rest of us and our country\\'s racist history. \"Largely, these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world,\" he said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . Comparative data on the racial make-up of these organizations is impossible to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race. From 2003 to 2006, Hughey spent time interviewing students from Greek organizations at three colleges on the East Coast. \"At the time of interviews, the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members, and there was an average of 2.4 nonwhite members per organization,\" he wrote in a 2010 paper published by Society for the Study of Social Problems. That\\'s 3.8% minority members, in those instances. Hughey\\'s sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who\\'s spent time on a college campus knows to be true: There are white fraternities and there are black ones. Sometimes we even dare call them that. Far too many of us, especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in Greek life, either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism, sexism and violence in the U.S. Greek system as somehow isolated. It\\'s clear that\\'s not the case. \"In 1992, Texas A&M University fined its chapter $1,000 after it threw a \\'jungle party\\' attended by frat brothers in blackface. Then in 2002, Syracuse University suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface. As recently as 2013, the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed African American students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs,\" according to The Washington Post\\'s Terrence McCoy. All of that was just SAE. Other examples are easy to come by, too. According to The New York Daily News, here\\'s the text of an invitation to a 2013 Asian-themed Kappa Sigma party at Duke University: \"We look forward to having Mi, Yu, You and Yo Friends over for some Sake. Chank You.\" And in January 2014, according to The New York Times, Arizona State University investigated an MLK-day party hosted by the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in which \"nonblack students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs and drinking from hollowed-out watermelons.\" It\\'s clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing. One easy place to start would be simply getting more information. Why don\\'t universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is? Hughey told me that data isn\\'t available. Then we could know the answers to some interesting questions: How segregated are Greek organizations? Are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others? What\\'s the trend over time? Is there progress? John Lewis on Oklahoma students: \\'They should be gone\\' Universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations. Do traditionally black and Latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats? If not, why? And why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place? What does that do to the student body as a whole? I\\'m not calling for an end to the Greek system. But it\\'s a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes. \"Any time there are racist remarks made, we must speak up as Americans,\" Boren, the OU president, said in a news conference. He added that he hopes the SAE students \"think long and hard\" about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week. \"I hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people,\" he said. The rest of us should do that, too.',\n",
       "       '(CNN)The next time someone accuses you of acting like a Neanderthal, don\\'t be offended.  Just say \"thank you.\" A new study published this month suggests Neanderthals were more \"cognitively advanced than we give them credit,\" Kansas University\\'s David Frayer said in a release. Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger. Only recently, however, did Frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000-year-old bones as ones modified by humans. \"I was stunned,\" Frayer said of the discovery.  \"It\\'s so obvious that these are cut.\" The markings, including polishes and areas where the bones were \"rubbed together,\" show that the talons were \"manipulated into a piece of jewelry,\" Frayer said. Frayer co-wrote \"Evidence for Neanderthal Jewelry: Modified White-tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina\" with three other Croatian scientists. Their research indicates Neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in Geico commercials, but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an \"advanced level of prowess\" in catching birds, according to Frayer. \"We can\\'t prove it, but we suspect that they were catching these birds,\" he said. Even with modern technology, catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do.  Frayer believes Neanderthals must have had excellent \"planning skills and ritual\" they would\\'ve used in catching the bird. \"Neanderthals are often thought of to be simple-minded mumbling, bumbling, stumbling fools,\" Frayer said. \"But the more we know about them the more sophisticated they\\'ve become.\"',\n",

       "       'Lynchburg, Virginia  (CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative firebrand from Texas, became the first Republican to announce his campaign for the presidency, and he spent Monday morning telling a crowd at the largest Christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office, and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign. \"These are all of our stories,\" Cruz told the audience Monday, roaming around the circular stage at Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, opening his remarks by spotlighting his family history and his own path to Washington. \"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\" Cruz drew on the past only to focus on the future, repeatedly and emphatically asking the Liberty University student audience to \"imagine\" the U.S. under conservative leadership -- laying out his vision for the country and a Cruz presidency. The senator from Texas, who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to Obamacare and his willingness to shut down the federal government, presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment Republicans such as Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- candidates Cruz coyly refers to as the \"mushy middle.\" Monday\\'s event was the last part of a carefully coordinated media rollout, following Cruz\\'s announcement of his candidacy in a 30-second video message posted on Twitter shortly after midnight on Monday, roughly 24 hours after the Houston Chronicle first reported his planned announcement. Ten thousand students from Liberty University crowded into the university\\'s main arena for Cruz\\'s announcement. The venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give Cruz an early boost among evangelical voters, who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like Iowa and South Carolina that have early nominating contests. It was a youthful crowd, as students are required to attend the University\\'s tri-weekly convocation address. Not all in the audience were guaranteed Cruz supporters: Several attendees sported red \"Stand with Rand\" shirts, repping Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month. Jerry Falwell Jr., the university\\'s president and son of its founder and evangelical icon, introduced Cruz as a senator who \"has gone against the tide\" and a \"man of great character,\" all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office. Falwell picked up on Cruz\\'s assertion that millions of evangelical Christians did not vote in 2012, pointing out that \"if any candidate can energize that group, it will make a huge difference in any national race.\" Asked after the speech how he prepared for the event, Cruz said he \"spent some time in prayer\" thinking about the message he wants to convey. \"At the end of the day it\\'s listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around,\" Cruz told CNN, adding that he was \"incredibly\" encouraged and inspired by the support. Cruz\\'s announcement came on the five-year anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which Cruz has fought in the Senate to repeal. Cruz marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal \"every word\" of the healthcare law as president. Cruz also jabbed at Common Core education standards -- which Bush supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the IRS, instead suggesting Americans could file their taxes on a postcard. And Cruz drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to \"imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\" Cruz\\'s advisers envision a three-pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the tea party faction and competing in the libertarian and Christian conservative circles. A constant and vocal critic of the Obama administration, Cruz is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against Obamacare in 2013, which led to a tense standoff between Democrats and Republicans and ultimately resulted in a 17-day government shutdown. The showdown was punctuated by Cruz\\'s 21-hour speech on the Senate floor. While popular in conservative and tea party circles, Cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the GOP base, according to public opinion polls. A CNN/ORC International survey conducted this month on the hypothetical Republican primary showed Cruz came in with 4% support among Republicans and independents who lean Republican. But the field is still relatively open, with the top contender -- Bush -- coming in at 16% support, followed by Scott Walker at 13%. But Cruz has relatively strong favorability numbers. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he is viewed in a positive light by 45% of Republicans, compared with only 8% who don\\'t have a favorable opinion of him. Still, 46% say they haven\\'t heard enough about him to form an opinion. Jason Miller, an adviser to Cruz\\'s campaign, confirmed that the campaign\\'s fund-raising target is $40 million, and the campaign believes it can raise $1 million in the first week. Cruz this month finished an early-voting state tour to Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire -- and he\\'s scheduled to return to New Hampshire on March 28 to speak at a brunch in Rockingham County. Depending on the Senate schedule this week, he could possibly make more early-state trips, according to advisers. After his speech Monday, he\\'ll head up to New York for media appearances and a fund-raiser. Cruz developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in Texas as a little-known candidate, forcing then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment Republican. Along with two other first-term senators who are expected to run for president (Rand Paul and Marco Rubio), Cruz will likely face questions over experience, an issue that Republicans brought up in 2008 against Barack Obama, who was also a first-term senator at the time. Before running for the Senate in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- Cruz was solicitor general of Texas and argued before the Supreme Court. He graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Born in Canada to a Cuban father and American mother, Cruz was a dual citizen until he renounced Canadian citizenship in 2014. He faced questions over whether he would qualify for the presidency, though law experts consider him a natural-born citizen because he was born to an American mother. Cruz was swarmed by students and reporters after he descended the stage and started to exit the arena. He took photos and signed autographs for about a half hour, as his team tried to escort him through the crowd. One girl who was raising money selling baked goods offered to give Cruz a dozen cupcakes for free but he pulled out his wallet and gave her $20. A pair of enthusiastic sisters shouted out to Cruz to tell him that, like his own daughters, they were also named Caroline and Catherine and were two years apart. \"That\\'s just cool,\" he said, as he gave them both high fives. \"That is awesome.\" One student who said she was Hispanic said she and her whole family were behind him. \"You have the Hispanic vote,\" she joked, then proceeded to start talking to him Spanish. While Cruz\\'s father is Cuban, he\\'s not fluent in Spanish. \"We grew up speaking Spanglish. My grandmother would be like \\'Nino, throw me the remote control\\',\" he said This is who we are as a people. We got to tell that story,\" Cruz said.

       "       '(CNN)Roberto Mancini says he carries Manchester City\\'s supporters in his heart -- but there\\'s not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the Premier League champions. Manuel Pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current City manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season. Mancini, the man who led Manchester City to its first Premier League title in 44 years back in 2012 says Pellegrini is \"lucky\" to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning England\\'s top division. Pellegrini, who led City to the domestic title last season, is under fire with City trailing Chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the European Champions League. \"I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players,\" Inter Milan coach Mancini told CNN\\'s Don Riddell on the eve of City\\'s crucial game with Barcelona in the Champions League. \"I think City can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year.\" Nicknamed \"the Engineer,\" Pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side\\'s title charge in recent weeks. The Chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its Premier League title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow Burnley last weekend. His team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night. City faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the European Champions League -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season. It must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture. Only once in nine attempts has Barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged Champions League knockout tie and not progressed. Pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at City but a number of those purchases have failed to impress. Eliaquim Mangala, who arrived from Porto for $47million has endured a dismal first season in English football, while $32million man Stevan Jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from Fiorentina. \"It\\'s my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League,\" said Mancini. \"It\\'s in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it\\'s the best team. \"In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute,\" perhaps a nod to City\\'s last gasp English Premier League title win in 2012, thanks to Sergio Aguero\\'s stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers. \"I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title.\" Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes in December 2009, enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure. He led the club to the FA Cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season. Under Mancini, the club attracted star players such as Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Aguero. He signed a new five-year deal with the club in July 2012 but results dipped with rival Manchester United regaining the league title and City suffering a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wigan. Mancini was criticised for his side\\'s lack of success in the Champions League, where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties. The Italian, 50, was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with Carlos Tevez, the Argentina striker, which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the City squad. In the 12 Champions League ties under his stewardship, City managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team\\'s failure on the European stage. At the time of his sacking, the club said that Mancini failed to hit \"stated targets\" and that it wanted to \"develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football\". \"I had a fantastic time in England,\" he added. \"We won the Premier League after many years. I have all City\\'s supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this. \"Maybe I miss the Premier League because I worked there for three-and-a-half years. I built the team that is now in second position. \"I think they play with the same players and I am very proud of this.\" Mancini faces a struggle of his own at Inter with the club unlikely to qualify for European competition next season. Inter is eighth in Serie A and is eight points off the qualifying places for the Europa League. It faces German side Wolfsburg in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday having lost the first leg 3-1.',\n",

Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Amy Amatangelo saying, \"Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue.\" Time\\'s James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, \"The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.\" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.',\n",
       "       'New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student\\'s application for an internship due to the South Asian nation\\'s \"rape problem.\" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn\\'t clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred \"many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons.\" \"It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,\" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. \"I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt.\" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig\\'s biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: \"What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?\" The post didn\\'t identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails\\' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: \"Unfortunately I don\\'t accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.\" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she \"never wrote\" such a message, claiming this email was \"put together from individual segments taken from different mails.\" \"I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, \" she added. \"I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way.\" Here\\'s what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate \"the laboratories are fully occupied.\" The Indian applicant \"didn\\'t accept\" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, \"I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now.\" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger referred to regular reports of \"multi-rape crimes\" and abuse of female tourists that, \"for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards (women).\" Such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male Indians \"and currently other European female associations are joining.\" \"Of course we cannot change or influence the Indian society,\" she added, \"but only take our consequences here in Europe.\" The idea that the professor wouldn\\'t accept male Indians for internships -- as reported by Quora and denied by the University of Leipzig -- riled up some in India, a number of whom wrote on the Quora thread. One user, identified as Sas Vijay, said, \"Don\\'t leave this issue. It is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds. File a complaint.\" Another user, posting as Hemanth Sriteja, wrote, \"I don\\'t wanna come to an era where I should say \\'Hii (sic), I\\'m from India, I\\'m not a rapist.\" One person echoing that view publicly is Michael Steiner, Germany\\'s ambassador to India. \"Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians,\" Steiner wrote Monday in a letter posted on the embassy website. \"Let\\'s be clear: India is not a country of rapists.\" The ambassador urged Beck-Sickinger \"to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which — in my opinion — is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher.\" CNN\\'s Harmeet Shah Sing and journalist Kunal Sehgal reported from India, and CNN\\'s Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

       "       '(CNN)Hey, nature, thanks for reminding us that you are not to be played with. Unless you are an adorable Australian quokka. We would play with them all day long. From battling water creatures to lions opening car doors, animals have taken center stage on social media. And this is not your typical animal kingdom. Check it out: . This bald eagle protecting her eggs in the snow in Pennsylvania has captured the Internet\\'s heart. There is even a live stream. According to Mashable, digital media producer Benjamin Savard was working on a video for the science department at Middlebury College in Vermont on Monday when he put a GoPro in a waterproof case inside an octopus tank. The octopus grabbed it, took some selfies and then snapped a shot of Savard. Which, of course, brings to mind the epic battle last month between an octopus and crab on an Australian beach. This octopus at the Seattle Aquarium decided enough was enough last month and tried to escape its tank. Land creatures are not to be outdone, however. A video from 2014 gained attention this week, showing a lion opening the car door of a family driving through a safari park in South Africa. As someone in the car says, \"Oh, my gosh, I didn\\'t know they could do that.\" We are still giggling at the #WeaselPecker phenomenon: a photo of a weasel hitching a lift on the back of a flying woodpecker.

       "       '(CNN)It\\'s seen a rapacious Leonardo DiCaprio rip-off the gullible, Sarah Jessica Parker ponder sweet amor and an air-headed Brad Pitt harbor intentions of blackmailing a CIA agent -- all just a bridge away from the madness of Manhattan. In the old times, Brooklyn\\'s historic Navy Yard would be lucky to attract the stars of the silver screen to a USO show. Today, its home to one of the largest film studios outside of Hollywood. The \"Wolf of Wall Street\", \"Sex and the City Two\" and \"Burn After Reading\" are just a few of the major motion pictures shot at Steiner Studios in recent times. More than 40 feature length and TV productions were filmed here in the last year alone. Studio chairman, Doug Steiner, opened the site just over 10 years ago. \"It was really awful looking with wild dogs -- literally wild dogs -- roaming the streets here,\" Steiner said. \"I liked the industrial landscape a lot and the opportunity. To me Brooklyn was a great opportunity waiting to happen because of the proximity to Manhattan.\" At its peak during World War II, the Brooklyn Navy Yard employed some 70,000 people. But the 1.2 square kilometer site fell into steep decline in the 1960s when the sailors moved out. Today, the yard is a vastly different place -- and not just because of the Hollywood A-listers strutting around. A non-profit corporation has been regenerating the location with the aim of creating new employment opportunities since the turn of the century. Steiner studios was one of the first tenants but others have followed. One former warehouse represents the corporation\\'s biggest project to date, with more than 90,000 square meters of space up for grabs and the potential creation of 3,000 new jobs. \"I think our influence on Brooklyn in general has been quite substantial,\" said David Ehrenberg, CEO of the Brooklyn Naval Yard Development Corporation. \"We were the first entity that started investing substantially back into these old buildings on the Brooklyn waterfront. \"And to some extent (we) proved a concept -- that manufacturing and industrial and creative companies would want to take root in Brooklyn,\" Ehrenberg said. Being at the forefront of these wider trends has helped attract a new type of workforce to the area. Steiner says housing prices within half a kilometer have risen up to ten times. Some 1,500 people already work at the studio, which is set on a path of rapid expansion. It is benefiting from the explosion in demand for high quality content across mobile devices - and Steiner sees it as part of a wider trend. \"Old media has always been based in New York City and continues to be based (here), film and television has been anchored in LA and high-tech has always been in northern California,\" Steiner said. \"But I think right now we\\'re seeing everything coming together in New York.\"',\n",
       "       '(CNN)The Palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of Israel, with images of missiles, terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across TV screens and newspapers. So you would think that security would be the central issue in Tuesday\\'s Israeli elections, right? The short answer is no. Poll after poll in Israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election. Indeed, even a majority of Israel\\'s Arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for Tuesday\\'s parliamentary poll, rather than advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What explains this apparent indifference? First, despite what the polls suggest, peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in Israeli politics. The main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue, and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks. Whatever they may say to pollsters, many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue. However, because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds, they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs, so their votes are not in play in these elections. This wasn\\'t always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left. However, for some time now, the majority of Israelis have shared a consensual position on the Palestinian question. In principle, they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process. However, in practice, that same majority believes that even if an Israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable, Israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile. Why? Experience has certainly taught middle Israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the Palestinians, irrespective of the complexion of the Israeli government. In 2000, for example, a Labor-led government agreed to a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, 97% of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, including the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount. Yet not only did Yasser Arafat reject the deal, but the Palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Add in the fact that subsequent unilateral Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon and Gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at Israeli civilians, and the 2008 decision by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reject Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\\'s peace proposal -- a plan similar to the Clinton parameters that Arafat rejected in 2000 -- and Israeli wariness is easy to understand. Since then, leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the Israeli public\\'s skepticism -- the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, only for Abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging American peace outline including this element, according to Israel\\'s Channel 2, even when he was presented with it directly by President Obama himself. As a result of all this, much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues, where voters hope political change in Israel can actually make a real difference to their lives. Indeed, the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is Moshe Kahlon\\'s centrist party Kulanu, whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in Israel. (Kahlon won fame in Israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market.) In keeping with the mood of the public, the ex-Likudnik presents a moderate image on the Palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security. In fact, one senior Israeli official told me that Kahlon\\'s team has been advised against even mentioning the word \"peace\" for the rest of the campaign. That says it all.',\n",

       "       '\\nOn a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was\\nsinging in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan\\ndistances \"above the Forties,\" of a new Opera House which should\\ncompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European\\ncapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every\\nwinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy. Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus\\nkeeping out the \"new people\" whom New York was beginning to dread and\\nyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic\\nassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so\\nproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music. It was Madame Nilsson\\'s first appearance that winter, and what the\\ndaily press had already learned to describe as \"an exceptionally\\nbrilliant audience\" had gathered to hear her, transported through the\\nslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family\\nlandau, or in the humbler but more convenient \"Brown coupe.\" To come to\\nthe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\\nas in one\\'s own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in\\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\\none\\'s own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy. It was\\none of the great livery-stableman\\'s most masterly intuitions to have\\ndiscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more\\nquickly than they want to get to it. When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no reason why\\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\\ncigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.\\nArcher allowed smoking. But, in the first place, New York was a\\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \"not the\\nthing\" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not \"the\\nthing\" played a part as important in Newland Archer\\'s New York as the\\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\\nforefathers thousands of years ago. The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had dawdled\\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\\nrealisation. This was especially the case when the pleasure was a\\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\\ndonna\\'s stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more\\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  \"He loves me--he\\nloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--\" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\\nwith notes as clear as dew. She sang, of course, \"M\\'ama!\" and not \"he loves me,\" since an\\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\\nGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be\\ntranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding of\\nEnglish-speaking audiences. This seemed as natural to Newland Archer\\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole. \"M\\'ama ... non m\\'ama ...\" the prima donna sang, and \"M\\'ama! \", with a\\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\\nthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\\nvictim. Newland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\\nhouse. Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott,\\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\\nattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\\nby some of the younger members of the family. On this occasion, the\\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott, and her daughter, Mrs. Welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\\nfixed on the stagelovers. As Madame Nilsson\\'s \"M\\'ama!\" thrilled out\\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\\nDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl\\'s cheek, mantled her brow\\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\\nsingle gardenia. She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw her\\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly. He drew a breath of\\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage. No expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\\nOpera houses of Paris and Vienna. The foreground, to the footlights,\\nwas covered with emerald green cloth. In the middle distance\\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\\nand red roses. Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank\\'s far-off\\nprodigies. In the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white\\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul\\'s\\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\\nthe right wing. \"The darling!\"',\n",

       "       'I never see pap when he didn\\'t want the chicken himself, but\\nthat is what he used to say, anyway. Mornings before daylight I slipped into corn-fields and borrowed a\\nwatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things\\nof that kind. Pap always said it warn\\'t no harm to borrow things if\\nyou was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it\\nwarn\\'t anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would\\ndo it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was\\npartly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three\\nthings from the list and say we wouldn\\'t borrow them any more--then he\\nreckoned it wouldn\\'t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it\\nover all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up\\nour minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the\\nmushmelons, or what. But toward daylight we got it all settled\\nsatisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p\\'simmons. We\\nwarn\\'t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain\\'t ever\\ngood, and the p\\'simmons wouldn\\'t be ripe for two or three months yet. We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\\nor didn\\'t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\\nlived pretty high. The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight,\\nwith a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a\\nsolid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of\\nitself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight\\nriver ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I,\\n\"Hel-_lo_, Jim, looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed\\nherself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The\\nlightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of\\nher upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy\\nclean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat\\nhanging on the back of it, when the flashes come. Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so\\nmysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would \\'a\\' felt when\\nI seen that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle\\nof the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little,\\nand see what there was there. So I says:\\n\\n\"Le\\'s land on her, Jim.\" But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\\n\\n\"I doan\\' want to go fool\\'n\\' \\'long er no wrack. We\\'s doin\\' blame\\' well,\\nen we better let blame\\' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not\\ndey\\'s a watchman on dat wrack.\" \"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain\\'t nothing to watch but\\nthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\\'s going to\\nresk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\\nit\\'s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" Jim\\ncouldn\\'t say nothing to that, so he didn\\'t try. \"And besides,\" I says,\\n\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain\\'s\\nstateroom. Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and\\n_they_ don\\'t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they\\nwant it.',\n",

In this family we are all children, and I\\nam the youngest.\" The daughters, who appeared to be very fond of him, were amused by\\nthis droll fact, particularly the Comedy daughter. \"My dears, it is true,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"is it not?

Have we not?\" \"Oh, yes, papa!\" cried the three daughters. \"In fact, that is our family department,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"in this\\nhurly-burly of life. We are capable of looking on and of being\\ninterested, and we DO look on, and we ARE interested. What more can\\nwe do? Here is my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I\\ndare say her marrying another child, and having two more, was all\\nwrong in point of political economy, but it was very agreeable. We\\nhad our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social\\nideas. She brought her young husband home one day, and they and their\\nyoung fledglings have their nest upstairs.

       "       'If he drank\\nnow and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or\\na pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to\\nlook at a beer-stained pink \"sporting paper,\" with pictures of murderers\\nand half-naked women. It was for such pleasures as these that he spent\\nhis money; and such was his life during the six weeks and a half that he\\ntoiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable them to break the grip of\\ntheir teamsters\\' union. In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of\\nthe laborers. On an average, the tunneling cost a life a day and several\\nmanglings; it was seldom, however, that more than a dozen or two men\\nheard of any one accident. The work was all done by the new boring\\nmachinery, with as little blasting as possible; but there would be\\nfalling rocks and crushed supports, and premature explosions--and in\\naddition all the dangers of railroading. So it was that one night, as\\nJurgis was on his way out with his gang, an engine and a loaded car\\ndashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him\\nupon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete wall and knocking\\nhim senseless. When he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of\\nan ambulance. He was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was\\nthreading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds. They took\\nhim to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he\\nwas washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of\\nmaimed and mangled men. Jurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest\\nChristmas he had had in America. Every year there were scandals and\\ninvestigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that doctors\\nwere allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients; but Jurgis\\nknew nothing of this--his only complaint was that they used to feed him\\nupon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in Packingtown would\\nfeed to his dog. Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned\\ncorned beef and \"roast beef\" of the stockyards; now he began to\\nunderstand--that it was what you might call \"graft meat,\" put up to\\nbe sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and\\nsailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, \"shantymen\" and gangs of\\nrailroad laborers. Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks. This\\ndid not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to\\nwork, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and\\nthat his place was needed for some one worse off than he. That he was\\nutterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the\\nmeantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities,\\nnor any one else in the city. As it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his\\nlast week\\'s board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance of\\nhis Saturday\\'s pay. He had less than seventy-five cents in his pockets,\\nand a dollar and a half due him for the day\\'s work he had done before he\\nwas hurt. He might possibly have sued the company, and got some damages\\nfor his injuries, but he did not know this, and it was not the company\\'s\\nbusiness to tell him. He went and got his pay and his tools, which he\\nleft in a pawnshop for fifty cents. Then he went to his landlady,\\nwho had rented his place and had no other for him; and then to his\\nboardinghouse keeper, who looked him over and questioned him. As he must\\ncertainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded there only\\nsix weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be worth the risk\\nto keep him on trust. So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight. It was\\nbitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his face. He had no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five\\ncents in his pocket, with the certainty that he could not earn another\\ncent for months. The snow meant no chance to him now; he must walk along\\nand see others shoveling, vigorous and active--and he with his left arm\\nbound to his side! He could not hope to tide himself over by odd jobs\\nof loading trucks; he could not even sell newspapers or carry satchels,\\nbecause he was now at the mercy of any rival. Words could not paint the\\nterror that came over him as he realized all this. He was like a wounded\\nanimal in the forest; he was forced to compete with his enemies upon\\nunequal terms. There would be no consideration for him because of his\\nweakness--it was no one\\'s business to help him in such distress, to make\\nthe fight the least bit easier for him. Even if he took to begging, he\\nwould be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he was to discover in good\\ntime.',\n",

       "       'It was in vain for me to say, \"Now, Stubbs, I\\nfeel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride\\na little while,\" for the moment I left him, he stood stock still\\nagain. Consequently I was obliged to lead the way, as before; and in\\nthis order we returned home, to the great delight of the village. Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages, I\\nam sure, for in a week\\'s time the people were so glad to see us go\\nby, though ever so frequently in the course of a day, that there were\\nfaces of greeting in every cottage. I had known many of the grown\\npeople before and almost all the children, but now the very steeple\\nbegan to wear a familiar and affectionate look. Among my new friends\\nwas an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and\\nwhitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on\\nits hinges, it shut up the whole house-front. This old lady had a\\ngrandson who was a sailor, and I wrote a letter to him for her and\\ndrew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him\\nup and where his old stool yet occupied its old place. This was\\nconsidered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the\\nworld, but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth, in\\nwhich he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way\\nto America, and from America would write again, I got all the credit\\nthat ought to have been given to the post-office and was invested\\nwith the merit of the whole system. Thus, what with being so much in the air, playing with so many\\nchildren, gossiping with so many people, sitting on invitation in so\\nmany cottages, going on with Charley\\'s education, and writing long\\nletters to Ada every day, I had scarcely any time to think about that\\nlittle loss of mine and was almost always cheerful. If I did think of\\nit at odd moments now and then, I had only to be busy and forget it. I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said,\\n\"Mother, why is the lady not a pretty lady now like she used to be?\" But when I found the child was not less fond of me, and drew its soft\\nhand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch,\\nthat soon set me up again. There were many little occurrences which\\nsuggested to me, with great consolation, how natural it is to gentle\\nhearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority. One of\\nthese particularly touched me. I happened to stroll into the little\\nchurch when a marriage was just concluded, and the young couple had\\nto sign the register. The bridegroom, to whom the pen was handed first, made a rude cross\\nfor his mark; the bride, who came next, did the same. Now, I had\\nknown the bride when I was last there, not only as the prettiest girl\\nin the place, but as having quite distinguished herself in the\\nschool, and I could not help looking at her with some surprise. She\\ncame aside and whispered to me, while tears of honest love and\\nadmiration stood in her bright eyes, \"He\\'s a dear good fellow, miss;\\nbut he can\\'t write yet--he\\'s going to learn of me--and I wouldn\\'t\\nshame him for the world!\" Why, what had I to fear, I thought, when\\nthere was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man\\'s daughter! The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown,\\nand the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my\\nold one. Charley was wonderful to see, she was so radiant and so\\nrosy; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole\\nnight. There was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of Chesney Wold\\nwhere a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view. The wood had\\nbeen cleared and opened to improve this point of sight, and the\\nbright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at\\nleast once every day. A picturesque part of the Hall, called the\\nGhost\\'s Walk, was seen to advantage from this higher ground; and the\\nstartling name, and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had\\nheard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it, mingled with the view and\\ngave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real\\ncharms. There was a bank here, too, which was a famous one for\\nviolets; and as it was a daily delight of Charley\\'s to gather wild\\nflowers, she took as much to the spot as I did. It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house\\nor never went inside it. The family were not there, I had heard on my\\narrival, and were not expected. I was far from being incurious or\\nuninterested about the building; on the contrary, I often sat in this\\nplace wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a\\nfootstep really did resound at times, as the story said, upon the\\nlonely Ghost\\'s Walk. The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock\\nhad impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the\\nhouse even when she was absent. I am not sure. Her face and figure\\nwere associated with it, naturally; but I cannot say that they\\nrepelled me from it, though something did.',\n",
       "       'But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.\\nJackson\\'s breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\\nwhat he wanted to know. The club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts\\'s opera-glass. For a moment he\\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\\ntwist, and said simply:  \"I didn\\'t think the Mingotts would have tried\\nit on.\" Newland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a\\nstrange state of embarrassment. It was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided\\nattention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothed\\nwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not\\nidentify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presence\\ncreated such excitement among the initiated. Then light dawned on him,\\nand with it came a momentary rush of indignation. No, indeed; no one\\nwould have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on! But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind\\nhim left no doubt in Archer\\'s mind that the young woman was May\\nWelland\\'s cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as \"poor\\nEllen Olenska.\" Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe\\na day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not\\ndisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying\\nwith old Mrs. Mingott. Archer entirely approved of family solidarity,\\nand one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their\\nresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock\\nhad produced. There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man\\'s\\nheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by\\nfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but\\nto receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing\\nfrom producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the\\nvery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer,\\nwas to be announced within a few weeks. No, he felt as old Sillerton\\nJackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on! He knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenue\\'s\\nlimits) that old Mrs. Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, would\\ndare. He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in\\nspite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with a\\nfather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough\\nto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the\\nwealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to \"foreigners\" (an\\nItalian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch to\\nher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone\\n(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in\\nthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park. Old Mrs. Mingott\\'s foreign daughters had become a legend. They never\\ncame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons\\nof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her\\nhabit, had philosophically remained at home. But the cream-coloured\\nhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisian\\naristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she\\nthroned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the\\nTuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as\\nplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above\\nThirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened like\\ndoors instead of sashes that pushed up. Every one (including Mr. Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that old\\nCatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York,\\njustified every success, and excused a certain number of failings. Unkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won her\\nway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of\\nhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency\\nand dignity of her private life. Mr. Manson Mingott had died when she\\nwas only twenty-eight, and had \"tied up\" the money with an additional\\ncaution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold young\\nwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,\\nmarried her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable\\ncircles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarly\\nwith Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend of\\nMme. Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first to\\nproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only\\nrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier\\nCatherine. Mrs. Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband\\'s\\nfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of\\nher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when\\nshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it\\nshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the\\ntransient pleasures of the table. Therefore, for totally different\\nreasons, her food was as poor as Mrs. Archer\\'s, and her wines did\\nnothing to redeem it. Her relatives considered that the penury of her\\ntable discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associated\\nwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the\\n\"made dishes\" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of\\nher son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the\\nbest chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  \"What\\'s the use of\\ntwo good cooks in one family, now that I\\'ve married the girls and can\\'t\\neat sauces?\" Newland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his\\neyes toward the Mingott box. He saw that Mrs. Welland and her\\nsister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the\\nMingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,\\nand that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due\\nto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of\\nthe situation. As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully\\nin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,\\nas she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New York\\nwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for\\nwishing to pass unnoticed. Few things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against\\n\"Taste,\" that far-off divinity of whom \"Form\" was the mere visible\\nrepresentative and vicegerent. Madame Olenska\\'s pale and serious face\\nappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy\\nsituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from\\nher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him. He hated to think of May\\nWelland\\'s being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless\\nof the dictates of Taste.',\n",
       "       'Look at it.\" Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might. \"When it looks a bit greenish an\\' juicy like that, it\\'s wick,\" he\\nexplained. \"When th\\' inside is dry an\\' breaks easy, like this here\\npiece I\\'ve cut off, it\\'s done for. There\\'s a big root here as all this\\nlive wood sprung out of, an\\' if th\\' old wood\\'s cut off an\\' it\\'s dug\\nround, and took care of there\\'ll be--\" he stopped and lifted his face\\nto look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him--\"there\\'ll be a\\nfountain o\\' roses here this summer.\" They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong\\nand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood\\naway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green\\nlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell\\ntoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry\\nout joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade\\nof moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He\\nshowed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade\\nand stirred the earth and let the air in. They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses\\nwhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation\\nof surprise. \"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \"Who did that\\nthere?\" It was one of Mary\\'s own little clearings round the pale green points. \"I did it,\" said Mary. \"Why, I thought tha\\' didn\\'t know nothin\\' about gardenin\\',\" he exclaimed. \"I don\\'t,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and the grass was so\\nthick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So I made a place for them. I don\\'t even know what they are.\" Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile. \"Tha\\' was right,\" he said. \"A gardener couldn\\'t have told thee better. They\\'ll grow now like Jack\\'s bean-stalk. They\\'re crocuses an\\'\\nsnowdrops, an\\' these here is narcissuses,\" turning to another patch,\\n\"an here\\'s daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.\" He ran from one clearing to another. \"Tha\\' has done a lot o\\' work for such a little wench,\" he said, looking\\nher over. \"I\\'m growing fatter,\" said Mary, \"and I\\'m growing stronger.',\n",
       "       'Tulkinghorn.\" What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture? Why does\\nshe come so close? What is the letter that she holds? \"Lady Dedlock, my dear Lady, my good Lady, my kind Lady! You must\\nhave a heart to feel for me, you must have a heart to forgive me. I\\nwas in this family before you were born. I am devoted to it. But\\nthink of my dear son wrongfully accused.\" \"I do not accuse him.\" \"No, my Lady, no. But others do, and he is in prison and in danger. Oh, Lady Dedlock, if you can say but a word to help to clear him, say\\nit!\" What delusion can this be? What power does she suppose is in the\\nperson she petitions to avert this unjust suspicion, if it be unjust? Her Lady\\'s handsome eyes regard her with astonishment, almost with\\nfear. \"My Lady, I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in\\nmy old age, and the step upon the Ghost\\'s Walk was so constant and so\\nsolemn that I never heard the like in all these years. Night after\\nnight, as it has fallen dark, the sound has echoed through your\\nrooms, but last night it was awfullest. And as it fell dark last\\nnight, my Lady, I got this letter.\" \"What letter is it?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened\\nwhisper, \"My Lady, I have not breathed a word of it, I don\\'t believe\\nwhat\\'s written in it, I know it can\\'t be true, I am sure and certain\\nthat it is not true. But my son is in danger, and you must have a\\nheart to pity me. If you know of anything that is not known to\\nothers, if you have any suspicion, if you have any clue at all, and\\nany reason for keeping it in your own breast, oh, my dear Lady, think\\nof me, and conquer that reason, and let it be known! This is the most\\nI consider possible. I know you are not a hard lady, but you go your\\nown way always without help, and you are not familiar with your\\nfriends; and all who admire you--and all do--as a beautiful and\\nelegant lady, know you to be one far away from themselves who can\\'t\\nbe approached close. My Lady, you may have some proud or angry\\nreasons for disdaining to utter something that you know; if so, pray,\\noh, pray, think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been\\npassed in this family which she dearly loves, and relent, and help to\\nclear my son! My Lady, my good Lady,\" the old housekeeper pleads with\\ngenuine simplicity, \"I am so humble in my place and you are by nature\\nso high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child,\\nbut I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg\\nand pray you not to be scornful of us if you can do us any right or\\njustice at this fearful time!\" Lady Dedlock raises her without one word, until she takes the letter\\nfrom her hand.',\n",
       "       'Rooms are locked up and gardens are\\nlocked up--and you! Have you been locked up?\" \"No. I stay in this room because I don\\'t want to be moved out of it. It tires me too much.\" \"Does your father come and see you?\" Mary ventured. \"Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn\\'t want to see me.\" \"Why?\" Mary could not help asking again. A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy\\'s face. \"My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at\\nme. He thinks I don\\'t know, but I\\'ve heard people talking. He almost\\nhates me.\" \"He hates the garden, because she died,\" said Mary half speaking to\\nherself. \"What garden?\" the boy asked. \"Oh! just--just a garden she used to like,\" Mary stammered. \"Have you\\nbeen here always?\" \"Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to\\nplaces at the seaside, but I won\\'t stay because people stare at me. I\\nused to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor\\ncame from London to see me and said it was stupid. He told them to\\ntake it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I\\ndon\\'t want to go out.\" \"I didn\\'t when first I came here,\" said Mary. \"Why do you keep looking\\nat me like that?\" \"Because of the dreams that are so real,\" he answered rather fretfully.',\n",
       "       'There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and\\nended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she\\nwould slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were\\nany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when\\nshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she\\nheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it\\nwas. It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she\\nstopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back\\nagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy\\nabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such\\nround and such blue eyes in any boy\\'s face. And on the trunk of the\\ntree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him,\\nand from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up\\nand sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they\\nwere all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little\\ncall his pipe seemed to make. When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost\\nas low as and rather like his piping. \"Don\\'t tha\\' move,\" he said. \"It\\'d flight \\'em.\" Mary remained\\nmotionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the\\nground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were\\nmoving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel\\nscampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew\\nhis head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away,\\nthough not at all as if they were frightened. \"I\\'m Dickon,\" the boy said. \"I know tha\\'rt Miss Mary.\" Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was\\nDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the\\nnatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and\\nhis smile spread all over his face. \"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha\\' makes a quick move it\\nstartles \\'em. A body \\'as to move gentle an\\' speak low when wild things\\nis about.\" He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but\\nas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she\\nspoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy. \"Did you get Martha\\'s letter?\" she asked. He nodded his curly, rust-colored head. \"That\\'s why I come.\" He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground\\nbeside him when he piped. \"I\\'ve got th\\' garden tools.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read\\nand write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to\\nsix times seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get\\nany further than that if I was to live forever. I don\\'t take no stock\\nin mathematics, anyway. At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got\\nnext day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to\\nschool the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the\\nwidow\\'s ways, too, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me. Living in a house\\nand sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the\\ncold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and\\nso that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting\\nso I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was\\ncoming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she\\nwarn\\'t ashamed of me. One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I\\nreached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of\\nme, and crossed me off. She says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry;\\nwhat a mess you are always making!\" The widow put in a good word for\\nme, but that warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well\\nenough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to\\nbe. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t\\none of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked\\nalong low-spirited and on the watch-out. I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\\nthrough the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\\nground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks. They had come up from the quarry\\nand stood around the stile awhile, and then went on around the garden\\nfence. It was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so. I\\ncouldn\\'t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to\\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I\\ndidn\\'t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in\\nthe left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my\\nshoulder every now and then, but I didn\\'t see nobody. I was at Judge\\nThatcher\\'s as quick as I could get there. He said:\\n\\n\"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.',\n",
       "       '\\n\\nThe news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the\\npeople tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them\\nputting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle\\nof a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would\\nsay, over a fence:\\n\\n\"Is it _them?_\"\\n\\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\\n\\n\"You bet it is.\" When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\\nthree girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but\\nthat don\\'t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her\\nface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her\\nuncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped\\nfor them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they _had_\\nit! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet\\nagain at last and have such good times. Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then\\nhe looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs;\\nso then him and the duke, with a hand across each other\\'s shoulder,\\nand t\\'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there,\\neverybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise\\nstopping, people saying \"\\'Sh!\" and all the men taking their hats off\\nand drooping their heads, so you could \\'a\\' heard a pin fall. And when\\nthey got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one\\nsight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could \\'a\\' heard them to\\nOrleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\\'s necks,\\nand hung their chins over each other\\'s shoulders; and then for three\\nminutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that\\ndamp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of\\nthe coffin, and t\\'other on t\\'other side, and they kneeled down and\\nrested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to\\nthemselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you\\nnever see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to\\nsobbing right out loud--the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly,\\nwent up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn,\\non the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up\\ntowards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and\\nwent off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never\\nsee anything so disgusting. Well, by and by the king he gets up and\\ncomes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a\\nspeech, all full of tears and flapdoodle, about its being a sore trial\\nfor him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing\\ndiseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it\\'s\\na trial that\\'s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy\\nand these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out\\nof his brother\\'s heart, because out of their mouths they can\\'t, words\\nbeing too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it\\nwas just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen,\\nand turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust. And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the\\ncrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their\\nmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church\\nletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and\\nhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and\\nbully. Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\\nnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the\\nfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up\\nwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying\\nyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that\\nwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he\\nwill name the same, to wit, as follows, viz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and\\nDeacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi\\nBell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley. Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\\ntogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to\\nt\\'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was\\naway up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so\\nthey all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked\\nto him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn\\'t say\\nnothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel\\nof sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said\\n\"Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo\" all the time, like a baby that can\\'t talk. So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty\\nmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts\\nof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to\\nGeorge\\'s family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote\\nhim the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them\\nout of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat. Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the\\nking he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house\\nand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the\\ntanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other\\nhouses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand\\ndollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand\\ncash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said they\\'d go and fetch\\nit up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come\\nwith a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found\\nthe bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all\\nthem yaller-boys. My, the way the king\\'s eyes did shine!',\n",
       "       '\\nBut they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came\\nsome very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which\\ntwo things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him\\ninto a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning\\nto do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes,\\nto talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and\\nhedges and on the borders of streams. The things he had to tell about\\notters\\' and badgers\\' and water-rats\\' houses, not to mention birds\\'\\nnests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost\\ntremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an\\nanimal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety\\nthe whole busy underworld was working. \"They\\'re same as us,\" said Dickon, \"only they have to build their homes\\nevery year. An\\' it keeps \\'em so busy they fair scuffle to get \\'em\\ndone.\" The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made\\nbefore Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the\\ngarden. No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after\\nthey turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk\\noutside the ivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and\\nmore fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was\\none of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever\\nsuspect that they had a secret. People must think that he was simply\\ngoing out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object\\nto their looking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks\\nabout their route. They would go up this path and down that one and\\ncross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they\\nwere looking at the \"bedding-out plants\" the head gardener, Mr. Roach,\\nhad been having arranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do\\nthat no one would think it at all mysterious. They would turn into the\\nshrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of\\nmarch made by great generals in time of war. Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the\\ninvalid\\'s apartments had of course filtered through the servants\\' hall\\ninto the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding\\nthis, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from\\nMaster Colin\\'s room to the effect that he must report himself in the\\napartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to\\nspeak to him. \"Well, well,\" he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,\\n\"what\\'s to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn\\'t to be looked at\\ncalling up a man he\\'s never set eyes on.\" Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a\\nglimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his\\nuncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard\\noftenest was that he might die at any moment and there had been\\nnumerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs,\\ngiven by people who had never seen him. \"Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,\" said Mrs. Medlock, as\\nshe led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened\\nthe hitherto mysterious chamber. \"Let\\'s hope they\\'re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,\" he answered. \"They couldn\\'t well change for the worse,\" she continued; \"and queer as\\nit all is there\\'s them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand\\nup under. Don\\'t you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in\\nthe middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby\\'s Dickon more at home than\\nyou or me could ever be.\" There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately\\nbelieved. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently. \"He\\'d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,\"\\nhe said. \"And yet it\\'s not impudence, either. He\\'s just fine, is that\\nlad.\"',\n",
       "       'I felt that\\nno one--mother, sister, wife--could honour him more than I. I did,\\nindeed! My poor little visitor made me a present of the account, and when as\\nthe evening began to close in she rose to take her leave, lest she\\nshould miss the coach by which she was to return, she was still full\\nof the shipwreck, which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to\\nunderstand in all its details. \"My dear,\" said she as she carefully folded up her scarf and gloves,\\n\"my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon him. And no\\ndoubt he will. You are of that opinion?\" That he well deserved one, yes. That he would ever have one, no. \"Why not, Fitz Jarndyce?\" she asked rather sharply. I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men\\ndistinguished by peaceful services, however good and great, unless\\noccasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very\\nlarge amount of money. \"Why, good gracious,\" said Miss Flite, \"how can you say that? Surely\\nyou know, my dear, that all the greatest ornaments of England in\\nknowledge, imagination, active humanity, and improvement of every\\nsort are added to its nobility! Look round you, my dear, and\\nconsider. YOU must be rambling a little now, I think, if you don\\'t\\nknow that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the\\nland!\" I am afraid she believed what she said, for there were moments when\\nshe was very mad indeed. And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to\\nkeep. I had thought, sometimes, that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that\\nif he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me\\nbefore he went away. I had thought, sometimes, that if he had done\\nso, I should have been glad of it. But how much better it was now\\nthat this had never happened! What should I have suffered if I had\\nhad to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as\\nmine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his\\nbondage to one whom he had never seen! Oh, it was so much better as it was! With a great pang mercifully\\nspared me, I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all\\nhe had so brightly shown himself; and there was nothing to be undone:\\nno chain for me to break or for him to drag; and I could go, please\\nGod, my lowly way along the path of duty, and he could go his nobler\\nway upon its broader road; and though we were apart upon the journey,\\nI might aspire to meet him, unselfishly, innocently, better far than\\nhe had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes, at the\\njourney\\'s end.',\n",

At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised\\nthat he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But in\\nthe midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to\\nDickon. \"Wheel me over there!\" he commanded. \"Wheel me quite close and stop\\nright in front of him!\" And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which\\nmade his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes\\nwhich came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach\\nbecause a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great\\nblack-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him. And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff\\'s nose. It was really no\\nwonder his mouth dropped open. \"Do you know who I am?\" demanded the Rajah. How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on what\\nwas before him as if he were seeing a ghost.

       "       'this is a throwaway since this story will make me identifiable to co-workers.\\n\\ni work for one of the larger comic-book publishers, and have for the last six or so years. when i was within my first ninety days, i cost my company thousands of dollars due to extreme ineptitude.\\n\\nthe first incident happened while i was assisting an editor on a new project. an artist had sent us line art on 11 x 17 comic book boards and had shipped them flat. the packaging was really awkward and sealed shut with packing tape. i really, really had to dig with the box cutter to free the art. predictably, i sliced through twenty-two pages of brand-new, unscanned comic-book art. the company not only had to pay the page rate for the art, but had to buy the pages off that person as well.\\n\\nthe second incident was worse. i was a little further in to my time here, and they wanted to see if i had what it took to manage a project. they put me in charge of handling one of the archive books, which is basically just a reprint of extremely old material. the original film for these comics was either lost or had deteriorated years ago, so we had to borrow someone\\'s extremely rare collection and scan every single page so that we could digitally clean them up and reprint them. my job at that point, was to place post-it notes on the pages that were not to be scanned--ads, back up stories that we didn\\'t have rights to, etc. i did that for hundreds of comics, writing \"do not scan\" on every post-it note with permanent marker. what i didn\\'t know, was that when stacked on top of each other, the paper from these comics was very absorbent, and leached the \"do not scan\" from each post-it note, so we had hundreds of comics with \"nacs ton od\" on the opposing page of the note. we had to replace the entire collection. i guess i shouldn\\'t have said the collection was priceless since... well... it had a very definite price. i\\'m surprised that they kept me on.\\n\\nbonus screw up: before i worked on the publishing side of comics, i worked comic-book retail. in most comic book stores, you have loyal customers who \"subscribe\" to various comics through a box system. they want spider-man, we pull the latest issue and put it in their box. i worked at a store with hundreds of box holders. \\n\\none day, i was working the register. when you have a long line, and you\\'ve worked retail for as long as i did, your movements become mechanical--scan, total, change, bag, hand to customer. i got so that i didn\\'t need to look at what i was doing to do it properly. \\n\\ni should have looked.\\n\\nmy boss put his battery bottle jolt cola down between me and the bags. i swung my hand toward the bags, the perfect specimen of efficiency, and i hit the can. the can went up, i juggled it a few times, and i should have let it drop, because what i did was, instead of letting it fall harmlessly on the floor, i knocked it, spraying blue foam, into all of the boxes. all of them. every box. ruining hundreds of paying customers mint-condition comics.',\n",

       "       'so recently i managed to snag a job catering for kids parties at this kind of jungle themed, kid-friendly café at my local club. aside from acting like the pills just kicked in to please the kids and serving food, i also do a drop \\'n\\' dine shift, where parents can drop their kids off for some good ol\\' fashioned fun in the jungle gym and have dinner next door.  \\nmy glorious fuck-up starts here. normal shift, most of the kids are following the rules and i hadn\\'t felt the urge to end any of them just yet. all was peaceful, all was running smoothly. i\\'m doing my rounds on the floor (telling kids not to climb up the slide and to finish their meals whilst speaking in silly voices) when i spot a girl crying by herself on a couch. this isn\\'t uncommon- most kids cry or have a tantrum at least once due to injury or missing their parents. eager to get this one back on her feet and having a good time, i take a seat with her, asking her whats wrong.  \\n\"i miss my daddy,\" she sobs, barely getting her words out through her hiccups. *she\\'s just waiting for dad to come back,* i think to myself, and i tell her that her daddy will be back for her very soon.  \\n\"my daddy is dead\".  \\nthe words hit me like an out-of-control breakdancer. unfortunately, my vague attempt at reassurance only made her cry even more uncontrollably, and there wasn\\'t a thing i could do but look around for someone who knew what they were doing.  \\ni\\'ve stopped kids crying before, but this was *way* out of my depth. i told the manager, who was surprisingly understanding, and i believe she was okay after a solid 20 minute talk with her new friend. but good lord, did i feel like a monster.',\n",
       "       'well, first of all, let me give you an idea about me. i am usually unlucky in a way that even makes me laugh. and in every airport i have been in, i get the \"random security search\" treatment, not only in the states, but also in europe and middle east. i\\'m ethnically white, however, i have spent fair amount of time under the sun, which puts me in a zone where i get to be hugged by every nation from middle east to south america.\\non this lucky day, i was traveling from my home country to usa where i was getting my undergrad education back in 2010. my flight was through london heathrow airport, where i was familiar with. the airline clerks could not get me checked into the flight from london to usa due to technical errors, so they have asked me to stop by the american airlines to get that fixed in london. \\n\\na couple of hours later, the clerk was checking my passport before checking me in, the usual. she found this extremely small rip in an empty page of my passport. but this wasn\\'t new, it happened 2 years ago. i had traveled like that for a while now. however, i have to give credit to my father that warned me billion times about this. \\nanyway, she told me that she needs to call an officer to ask if i can travel like that. at that point, i knew i was the gta level 2 suspect. a couple of minutes passed, and she told me i was all set. i knew that was a lie. so i grabbed myself a sandwich and fed myself, before i get in any trouble. a full stomach always makes things better. \\nso i went to my gate where i saw a handful of police officers checking the passports of the passengers. i was like, they are looking for me, i can feel it. they saw my passport, and ding ding ding ding!, bingo. \\n \\n - sir, could you step to this side please?\\n\\nthey have explained to me that i was not allowed to fly with a torn passport, so i was suggested to have a conversation with the clerk that caused this. i went back to the ticket place, and told her what happened. i could feel something funny was about to happen. so, she suggested that i should go to the embassy in london to fix this problem, and i thought that could work. \\ni went to the exit of the airport, and handed the piece of paper where i needed to fill in. reminder: i live in a country with a passport that requires a visa to %99 of the world. \\ni told the officer what happened, and she told me that she will get this situation fixed and let me go to london to sort this situation out, only with a visa for 24 hours. after half an hour, i assume a higher duty officer, a commander let\\'s say, came by. he asked me what makes me think i can travel to london without a proper passport when i could not travel to usa?  i told him that this was not my idea. he rolled his british eyes over, and probably said \"i\\'m not buying this paki boy.\" (no offence to pakistani people.) 15 mins later, he says i have got 1 good and 1 bad news. you cannot go to your embassy in london; you are going back to your own country. i said ok. what else i could say. 15 mins later, the commander said that there is no flight back tonight, so you will be our guest tonight. \\n\\ni told myself \"this is fine, i will spend a night at the airport hotel, and go home the next day with a funny story.\" i did go home the next day with a funny story, but i also get to be treated like i am the dark leader of some radical group. \\n\\nthey first took me to a questioning room, not like the one in the movies. it had computers, i was getting pictures taken, questions asked, and giving finger prints. i signed a paper that says \"it is not my fault that i could not travel to my final destination.\" they took my belongings, including my passport, and gave me a pillow, a blanket, a sandwich, and a peeled orange. i was taken to a room with 3 walls and 1 mirror, filled with people who have no passports, no visa, no life etc. you get the picture right? in addition to these, tv was placed in the wall, (so you cannot throw it), the chairs was fixed to the floor. i am getting the full isis treatment. one prepaid phone and one bathroom with no locks. i ate my meal and went to sleep, only to wake up to crying and yelling sounds that my possible inmates were making.\\n\\naround 2 am, an officer woke me up and told me that i will be questioned again. i got up, went to a hollywood-ish room. an officer asked me bunch of similar questions to see if i fail or stutter. something like. - why are you traveling to the usa?\\n+ i am an undergraduate student; i am getting my education there.\\nfew unrelated questions later. - what are you doing in the usa?\\n+ i am an undergraduate student; i am getting my education there.\\n\\ni passed the test, and went back to the chair i was sleeping. around 5 am, another officer woke me up. apparently, i was getting full body check-up for some reason. i was like, allright.\\naround 8.30 am, they woke me up. two police officers had my luggage, and one officer had my passport in a file. i was getting through securities without waiting and check-ups. i was 21, i was feeling like a million bucks due to the fact that people were looking at me like \"who is this mofo\". (excuse my french) i was laughing hard inside too.\\n\\ntwo police officers put my luggage to my flight and left. two undercover officers and the officer that was holding my passport traveled to my home country with me, only to make sure i don\\'t turn this flight around i guess. lol. they handed me to the officers at the airport. i got my passport fixed, and went back to the usa the next day.',\n",
       "       'so, being alone on christmas, i decided to make myself an elaborate meal. a teriyaki salmon dish was in the oven, brown rice was on the stove, and i was prepping a sautéed vegetable dish. the plan was to cook onions, carrots, green and red peppers in an asian sauce and a few slivers of habanero to spice it up a bit. \\n\\ni cut up the vegetables and began to cook them when i had a sudden urge to go to the bathroom. never did it occur to me that i should wash my hands before going to the bathroom but, in retrospect, that would have been ideal. i go urinate, wash my hands, and get back to the kitchen when i feel a burning sensation on my dick. this isn\\'t your run of the mill sunburn, this is a full blown \"my wiener is own fire, and it feels like a hot dog is in the process of being cooked\" sensation. i can\\'t even express the pain. i thought, \"what could this pain possibly be coming from, i can\\'t even remember the last time i had sex, so it\\'s definitely not an std, what is it?\" \\n\\nthen it hits me, the oils from the habanero had to have caused this pain, there is no other explanation. my mind immediately went into overdrive; how can i stop this unbearable pain? i tried everything: aloe, shaving cream, aftershave cream, you name it, it was on my junk. \\n\\nnone of these remedies worked. i was still in more pain than i have ever felt in my life. it was brutal. as i was standing in the bathroom while administering \"coolants\" i realized that a shower may do the trick. without hesitation, i turned on the shower, jumped in, and let the water cover the love below for at least 20 minutes. it was probably the most expensive shower of my life, but without a doubt the most soothing. as the pain started to diminish, i realized that i still had salmon in the oven that should have been finished 10 minutes ago. \\n\\nin the end, my meal was ruined, my nuts were on fire, and i was without any company for the holiday, but at least i had a good story to tell!',\n",
       "       \"a little back story: my family is devoutly muslim. i do not buy into it. i try to keep that quiet because i like living in a warm house. sometimes i slip up and make it seem like i do not believe. this makes them angry, but i can usually play it off, and make them forget. now on to the story!\\n\\n\\nrecently, a 'major muslim scholar' released a fatwa stating that the earth sits in a fixed place, not rotating or moving in any way, and that the sun revolves around the earth. they used the logic that 'how could you walk if the earth was moving?' when i overheard my family talking about this i immediately called total bullshit. i said that that is preposterous, and only a fool would believe that. i stated examples that every high-school student should know. things like basic physics, and the earth being far too small for the sun and the rest of the universe to revolve around it. you know, i used my own logic instead of believing what some cave-man taught other cave-men (did you know that aristotle believed women had less teeth than men? it could be disproved by simply looking and counting, but it was accepted as truth for hundreds of years, simply because he said it?). \\n\\n they said that i always take what scientists and doctors say over what the 'scholars' say. they lecture me on how bad this is. they said that someday the sun would rise from the west, and then it would be too late for people to believe, how could that happen if what i said was true. i, not wanting to make it seem like i did not believe, because, as i said before, i like living in a warm house, tried to explain it in a way that agreed with their faith. they did not quite buy it, but i was off the hook for now, even if they were more suspicious than ever. \\n\\nlater that day, one of my sisters and i got into an argument, i do not remember how it started, but she was arguing that if god chose to save a blind and deaf person stranded in the woods, with no hope of rescue, he could. i told her that was ridiculous, and that they would likely be dead before nightfall. she believed that a blind and deaf person, with no prior training could get food, shelter, fire, and protect themselves, simply because god helped them. i could not stop myself form telling her how ridiculous that was. she told my mother, who told my father. my ultra-religous brother-in-law encouraged my father to take me to more classes. i was supposed to go hang out with my brothers and friends, instead i go dragged to a class. they took my younger brother too, so it would not seem like i was being singled out, but i am not blind. \\n\\nso, now they are forcing me to go to classes, denying privileges if i refuse, trying to force the religion down my throat, and are more suspicious of me than ever, and my sisters are trying to force mt to read the quran with them, meanwhile my parents are discussing making pilgrimage to a muslim country to get me away from 'western influences'. i am pretty boned. i know one thing, though: the second i am a self-sufficient adult, muhammad and his oppressive religion can go suck on a pork sausage.\",\n",
       "       'on mobile, so excuse formatting.\\n\\nso about a month ago, i taught a ja (junior achievement) class at a local elementary school. i\\'m an education major, so i figured this would be good experience. i taught the same lesson to 5 different 5th grade classes throughout the day, and it was about creating a new product and giving a sales pitch. \\n\\ntowards the end of the day, i had a class that was rather rowdy, so i made sure to really watch over them and get involved in their projects. i stopped by one group of boys and was intrigued by their drawing. i asked what they were making, and one boy said, \"it\\'s a giant roller coaster!\" \\n\\nawesome! creativity! as i was about to give them a compliment on their project, one of the other boys looks at me and says, \"yeah! giant just like ryan\\'s mom!\" he pointed at ryan, and ryan looked at me with the saddest of eyes, hoping that the boy would be reprimanded. instead of being an adult, i fucking lost it. i laughed so hard, right in front of ryan. ryan proceeded to bawl his eyes out and start hitting his head off of his desk. \\n\\ni just walked away and told the actual teacher that he was having some sort of meltdown and stayed away from that group for the rest of their class. \\n\\n \\n\\nlaughed at a 5th grade \"your mom\" joke, made kid cry instead of being an adult, avoided kid rest of the day.\\n\\nedit. everyone needs to chill. i felt like shit after i did it, that\\'s why it\\'s on tifu...because i fucked up. the only teaching experience i had up to that point was with high school students, where this scenario would have played out a lot smoother. i guess it was just a natural reaction, and i guess that\\'s why i\\'m getting my degree in secondary ed. \\n\\nedit #2. before i walked away i looked at the other kids and asked them to focus on the project, but i will admit i didn\\'t do anything to help ryan because what the hell do i do with a kid that is repeatedly smashing his head off his desk? also, the joke wasn\\'t funny. i guess i laughed because i totally didn\\'t expect that kid to say it. kind of like one of those \"oh my god\" laughs. \\n\\nedit #3. this is my final edit. you better believe i would apologize to the kid now, but i won\\'t see him ever again unless i coincidentally teach another ja class with him in it. i\\'m looking at it a little more light-heartedly because he was all buddy buddy with his group until i showed up and the other kid said it. probably still should have talked to him, but we all make mistakes. definitely taking this as a learning experience. thanks for all the comments and upvotes! this is my first post to really take off.',\n",

       "       \"this is an ongoing fuck up, stared around 3 months ago, and i am still suffering the consequences of it. this probably won't be a funny story, as i just mean to vent a bit.\\n\\nit all started with my girlfriend and i looking for a job in germany. we met each other working in switzerland, i'm from holland and she is from slovakia, so we always speak german together. getting a job in a country where they speak german made the most sense. while looking for a job we were living in a small temporary flat in holland. at first the job search didn't go too well, its somewhat hard to find a job for two people at the same restaurant and/or hotel, especially if these two people are in love, employers dont seem to like that. but i really needed to find a job fast since i was in a little bit of debt with my health insurance company and still needed to pay back my student loans from years back. after two weeks of fruitless job searching i get a call from a friend, that tells us there is a small lunchroom in the town we live in that is looking to rent out. this lunchroom was furnished, and it had all the necessary machines and kitchenware to get it up and running. it would be perfect to run with just the two of us, since its a small place. they also asked a really low amount of rent, it seemed perfect, almost too perfect. we considered doing it for a couple of days, but we could never be sure what our income was going to be, since we would be the one's to get the lunchroom up and running from scratch. if we have had some money to spend we would have taken the risk right away, because who wouldn't want their own little restaurant? luckily more good news wasn't far off, and we were offered two positions as waiters in a big 4 star hotel in a beautiful area in south germany.\\n\\nall of the communication with this hotel was per email, and everything went extremely fast, almost a bit too fast. in less than 24 hours after telling the hotel we were going to come, they sent us our contracts, and wanted us to sign them and send them back asap. we glanced through it, all seemed fine, signed it, and sent it back. fast forward a week and we are in south germany working our first shift. immediately we find out why they were so eager for us, there were far to few staff members, the boss didn't seem very pleasant and the housing they provided us was not at all what we were promised. after talking to a few of the employees that were already working there we found out that it would be wise not to stay there long. we made allot of hours, and overtime work would not be payed. our room was old, the shared bathroom, (eleven people) was dirty and the food they served for the employees was not very nutritious. we were promised a 5 day work week, little to no overtime work, and an all new renovated employees house. we didn't even get to keep our tips, it was divided over all of the staff, (which is normal in a lot of hotels, but our co-workers told us that is was a very small amount of money, it didn't add up at all.) after a week of hard work because of a lack of co-workers, we had enough, and decided to go back to holland and try and run this lunchroom, since we were tired of looking for jobs. going to germany probably was fuck up number #1, since it almost cost me all the money i had left traveling there. in hindsight we should have just sucked it up, and kept working until i had my debts payed. but our ignorance told us we would be making some good money running our own little bistro, and since we both used to work in the restaurant business allot, what could go wrong?\\n\\nenough backstory, up to fuck up number #2. once back in holland, we signed a lease contract, and we were told we could do with the place whatever we wanted, only condition was that it had to be all organic food and drinks since it was next too an organic food store. all good, no problem, my girlfriend and i both want to eat healthy, this is a perfect way to do this. we start our preparations, making a menu, making a list of all the products we need, researching for popular and healthy drinks like smoothies, slow juices and freshly pressed wheat grass juice etc. we buy some things we use to make the place look nice, nothing too expensive, some plants, a few cheap paintings for on the wall and all that stuff. we use our last money to print out flyers and put up a small add in the local newspaper. we had a good feeling, and our first day confirmed that feeling. allot of people came by to check out the new place in town, we had a good day, and were very happy things seemed to work out for the better! unfortunately it did not last, and we soon found out it was just the hype of the openings day that drew people to us. since then it has been very quiet in our little bistro, some random people drop by once every full moon, far to little to make a living for 1 person, let alone 2. in the meantime, my debts are not getting paid, and we are stuck with the bistro for a couple more months. looking for a new job as we speak, we have given up trying to make our lunchroom run after allot of failed attempts at trying to get people to come. from handing out free samples of what we sell in the main street to handing out flyers and coming up with awesome offers, it was all in vain. we were located just outside the main street, the street that literally everybody goes too to do their shopping and dining. we underestimated this, and thought we could get the people to abandon their daily routines in this small town and come to us. it did not work. i'm pretty much stressing out, and needed to vent some of this. not sure what to do next, but i guess one way or another we will have to find out. thanks for reading my fuck up, and sticking with it till the end, even that means allot.\",\n",
       "       \"so earlier this morning i had a job interview, after a few issues when i got up i managed to get out of the house not forgetting a cd i had burned for my grandmother. so got to the interview and saw i was second there to a great looking lady in her nice office jacket with matching short gray skirt and heels (i starting thanking the gods for this site). the interview eventually started with us along with some other people doing some tests on computer then we were sent to sit down at a table to fill out the final forms. now she's next to me rubbing her legs together (kinda hard to miss) and playing with her long hair, before i knew it i got a boner going doing flips in my pants which is already slim fit. realizing i was about to be called up to give in my papers i held my breath to get rid of the boner n sure enough it worked so i was celebrating in my head since the whole room didn't see my raging boner. fast forward a few mins and i'm leaving the interview now only for my boner to have its revenge by giving me blue balls...to add to that i had to bring the cd by my grandmother who lived about a quarter mile from where i did the interview so i have to do the penguin walk with my blue balls to my grandmothers house all the while in cold sweat and pain...sigh. the interview went well though so i guess that's good.\",\n",

And now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave, carried\\nforward on the light Mendelssohn ripples, the spring day beckoning to\\nthem through widely opened doors, and Mrs. Welland\\'s chestnuts, with\\nbig white favours on their frontlets, curvetting and showing off at the\\nfar end of the canvas tunnel. The footman, who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel, wrapped\\nMay\\'s white cloak about her, and Archer jumped into the brougham at her\\nside. She turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands\\nclasped under her veil. \"Darling!\" Archer said--and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before\\nhim and he felt himself sinking into it, deeper and deeper, while his\\nvoice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully:  \"Yes, of course I thought\\nI\\'d lost the ring; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a\\nbridegroom didn\\'t go through that. But you DID keep me waiting, you\\nknow! I had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen.\" She surprised him by turning, in full Fifth Avenue, and flinging her\\narms about his neck. \"But none ever CAN happen now, can it, Newland,\\nas long as we two are together?\" Every detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the\\nyoung couple, after the wedding-breakfast, had ample time to put on\\ntheir travelling-clothes, descend the wide Mingott stairs between\\nlaughing bridesmaids and weeping parents, and get into the brougham\\nunder the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers; and there was\\nstill half an hour left in which to drive to the station, buy the last\\nweeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers, and\\nsettle themselves in the reserved compartment in which May\\'s maid had\\nalready placed her dove-coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new\\ndressing-bag from London. The old du Lac aunts at Rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal\\nof the bridal couple, with a readiness inspired by the prospect of\\nspending a week in New York with Mrs. Archer; and Archer, glad to\\nescape the usual \"bridal suite\" in a Philadelphia or Baltimore hotel,\\nhad accepted with an equal alacrity. May was enchanted at the idea of going to the country, and childishly\\namused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where\\ntheir mysterious retreat was situated. It was thought \"very English\"\\nto have a country-house lent to one, and the fact gave a last touch of\\ndistinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant\\nwedding of the year; but where the house was no one was permitted to\\nknow, except the parents of bride and groom, who, when taxed with the\\nknowledge, pursed their lips and said mysteriously:  \"Ah, they didn\\'t\\ntell us--\" which was manifestly true, since there was no need to. Once they were settled in their compartment, and the train, shaking off\\nthe endless wooden suburbs, had pushed out into the pale landscape of\\nspring, talk became easier than Archer had expected. May was still, in\\nlook and tone, the simple girl of yesterday, eager to compare notes\\nwith him as to the incidents of the wedding, and discussing them as\\nimpartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher. At\\nfirst Archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an\\ninward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil\\nunawareness. She was alone for the first time with her husband; but\\nher husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday. There was no\\none whom she liked as much, no one whom she trusted as completely, and\\nthe culminating \"lark\" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement\\nand marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey, like a grownup\\nperson, like a \"married woman,\" in fact. It was wonderful that--as he had learned in the Mission garden at St.\\nAugustine--such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of\\nimagination. But he remembered how, even then, she had surprised him\\nby dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience\\nhad been eased of its burden; and he saw that she would probably go\\nthrough life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as\\nit came, but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance. Perhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their\\ntransparency, and her face the look of representing a type rather than\\na person; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a Civic Virtue\\nor a Greek goddess. The blood that ran so close to her fair skin might\\nhave been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element; yet her\\nlook of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor\\ndull, but only primitive and pure. In the thick of this meditation\\nArcher suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a\\nstranger, and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding-breakfast and\\nof Granny Mingott\\'s immense and triumphant pervasion of it. May settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject. \"I was surprised,\\nthough--weren\\'t you?--that aunt Medora came after all. Ellen wrote\\nthat they were neither of them well enough to take the journey; I do\\nwish it had been she who had recovered! Did you see the exquisite old\\nlace she sent me?\"',\n",

       "       'throwaway. 2 weeks before finals, sitting mid way down the lecture hall (location is slightly important). happened to be enrolled in the same class as my ex and at this point, enough time has passed for us to be civil and we get along just fine as classmates/friends. during this class, phone is running low on juice and i forgot to bring my charger to school. ex saves the day, has a usb cable but since i take notes with my ipad, i didn\\'t really have anywhere to charge it from...so into her macbook pro it goes. i go back to taking notes just going about my nerding and this is where all hell basically broke loose. someone sitting in the row behind me whispers \"woah holy shit!\", being the oblivious idiot, i quickly look up at the board at what the prof is writing to see what crazy magic he pulled out of his ass. nothing new really on the board...ex beside me says \"uh...wtf?\" and turned her laptop to me. i look over and apple being apple, decides to be all smart and shit by loading up its mac photo app...plastering nudes that my current gf had sent me the night before all across her screen. i quickly reach over shut her laptop screen down, and stupidly look back to assess the damage. all eyes in the immediate area behind me were staring straight at me, not a single person behind me was following the lecture anymore. i turn back and my ex says..\"wtf was all that porn on your phone?\" without hesitation, i quickly justify its existence by assuring her it was just my gf\\'s nudes (which in hindsight probably didn\\'t help my situation). i pack my bag to leave asap, unplug my phone and that cursed thing drops one row below me. the seats are lined up in rows and each row is staggered like stairs. can\\'t reach my phone, can\\'t leave the class. manage to make enough noise to disrupt the entire class and lecture is now on pause. i don\\'t know how red my face must\\'ve been or if it was cause of the noise but my prof asked if i was ok and all i could do was shake my head and stare at my feet. class resumes and it was basically like being in a hyperbolic time chamber. class finally ends and i am still slightly shaking from all the embarrassment. beg my ex not to mention this to anyone but now i live my life in fear of my having my (both) heads ripped off at any given moment, it was pretty dam stupid. a passcode probably would have saved me from this situation and i put one in now. the only problem is it is a constant reminder everytime i punch in my passcode as to why it\\'s there in the first place. i am an idiot.',\n",
       "       'as is tradition, this incident happened back in the summer of 2009...\\n\\ni had just gotten out of the hospital in los angeles after being admitted for three days due to a bad flare up of my ulcerative colitis. i decided to visit my family in my hometown in central texas, so i booked an amtrak sleeper room that was traveling from la to san antonio, with my final destination being mcgregor, tx, which is about 20 minutes west of waco (yes, the two places recently known for magnolia realty from the popular show fixer upper, though that\\'s not at all relevant.) the trip basically takes 3 days, but it\\'s a great way to travel and decently priced, and i found the sleeper car to be very comfortable, especially with a laptop to watch movies. however, i would only get to enjoy one night on the train...\\n\\nso we depart los angeles at around noon, and the first stop was at a tiny train depot in palm springs. it was literally just a slab of concrete with a single bathroom. as the train stops at the tiny concrete outhouse in the late afternoon, we are informed that there will be a 5 minute break for smokers. well, i didn\\'t smoke cigarettes at the time, but i had just been released from the hospital a day earlier and i also had a medical marijuana card/rec for my uc (which absolutely helped me deal with the various issues caused by my chronic illness.) so, needing some relief for long ride, i decided to step off the train and smoke a little bit of green in the bathroom of the \\'depot\\'. unfortunately, whoever was using the restroom was taking forever, so when i realized it had been almost 5 minutes of waiting, i knew i wasn\\'t going to be able to succeed in my mission, so i turned around to walk back to the train...only to find out i had been given a new mission...as i witnessed the train slowly pulling away from the depot (with all of my bags and my laptop stored in my room on board.... i immediately tried to wave down the train, as if it was going to stop and let me back on haha. i almost had a mental breakdown in front of 5 people at the tiny depot. as fate would have it, a taxi had just pulled up to take someone to the palm springs airport. i had my phone, wallet, and pipe full of marijuhwahna in my pockets, so i asked the taxi driver if he could take me to the airport to try to rent a car. he graciously accepted and didn\\'t throw a little fit when i told him that all i had was a credit card instead of cash, which many cab drivers have done previously. i think he was more amazed/amused with my predicament.\\n\\nso i arrive at the airport and head to the only rental car kiosk that rents cars to 21 year olds (i had turned 21 six months earlier and many places only rent to people who are at least 25 years old.) i rented a nice compact ford focus, set the gps for el paso, and with hope in my heart i set out on my ~10 hour drive through the night. i still had my bowl of chronic, so a few hours into the drive i smoked, then stopped at a walmart to buy a cd for the rest of the drive (echoes: the best of pink floyd, because hell yeah!), as well as a dvd for when i eventually got back to my laptop (gangs of new york, because....well, because it\\'s awesome.) \\n\\nafter 10 hours of basically non-stop driving through the night and wee hours of the morning, i arrived in el paso about an hour before the train did, dropped off the rental car, took a taxi to the train station, had my ticket reprinted, and then patiently waited for a train to arrive... (while thinking of a dream i had-- sort of relevant lyrics to a great walkmen song.) once it did, i went to the train attendant who was checking tickets and told him about my epic fuck-up and why i was boarding with an la to mcgregor ticket. he looked at the ticket, looked at me with a stunned look on his face, and then said \"...man, get on the train and get some damn sleep!\" i got to my little room to find that my stuff had been exactly as i left it. before i went to sleep, i went to the dining car and had myself a delicious breakfast of eggs benedict-- an apropos meal for the betrayal of my own responsibility. i went to sleep and woke up many hours later once we arrived in san antonio at night. had dinner alone at a mediocre chain tex-mex restaurant on the river walk (in 100 degree heat with 99.999% humidity), watched gangs of new york in my room, and then went back to sleep until we arrived in austin in the morning, on the third day of the trip, before finally heading to my final destination of mcgregor. luckily, everything had gone according to the plan that was born of everything not going to the plan. \\n\\nneedless to say, it was one of the biggest screwups of my short life, but it\\'s also a hilarious story of idiocy, which i sometimes tell to new friends and strangers alike. i once told it to a customer from palm springs over the phone when i worked tech support, and he said he knew the exact train depot i got left at and began laughing while he told his buddy in the background all about the incident. glad it could still bring joy to random people years later haha. moral of the story: pay attention when getting off a train to smoke, and keep your eye on it no matter what... as if that needs to be mentioned anyway. i still loved the train ride though and highly recommend it! cheers.',\n",
